Some people say university students should pay for their tuition fees. Some others say the government should pay for the tuition fees. What is your opinion?,"Owing to high qualities and considerable expertise they have, college graduates stand a better chance of securing an ideal job, thus being paid much more than those without a decent schooling. If that is the case, college students, according to some people, should pay all the full cost, such as tuition fees, by themselves rather than government do. Truly if government is not obliged to shoulder the duty of paying for college students, a large sum of money can be saved to invest in other fields, but the subsequent detriments are more than alarming. Initially, tremendous economic pressure will hinder students learning efficiency. If students have to pay tuition fees alone, perhaps they will take up part-time jobs in their spare time which ought to be spent on relaxation or review of the lessons learned. Consequently physical exhaustion and mental stress deprive them of the possibility of studying efficiently.Furthermore, students usually lack social experience, so it is more likely that they are confronted with the dangers of being cheated or even life threatened.Such reports as female students as home tutors are raped or killed are not uncommon recently. Moreover, if college students are required to pay all the full cost, some talents born in poor families can never enter higher education and it is a great loss for the country. Some students from destitute areas are really promising, and if they can further study in one particular field, they are sure to become outstanding enough and make a great contribution to society. However, lack of sufficient money to support their future learning, they have to drop out of school, and it is absolutely a shame for government, whose function is to serve the people. All in all, the main duty of students is to acquire more knowledge, so it is never reason able to impose economic pressure on them. It is government that should be responsible for students'expenses.",8
Some people think that examinations have some bad effects on students. Some people say they have some good effects on education. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.,"In the long history of human education, great changes have taken place in every field of study. However, testing a person by examinations is still regarded as the only reliable and feasible method to measure one's knowledge and ability. From elementary schools to universities students have to take many examinations. They even regard examinations as an indispensable part of their life.Some people hold that examinations have negative impacts on students. First of all, examinations are unable to evaluate one's true ability. They can only test memory or the skill of working rapidly under pressure. Secondly, examinations encourage bad study habits. Students tend to lay emphasis on what will be tested. They are encouraged to memorize rather than to think. Finally, examinations lower the standards of teaching. Teachers have to train students in exam techniques instead of teaching their subjects.Many other people, however, believe examinations have some advantages. In the first place, they serve as a driving force to stimulate students to work hard. Laziness is part of human nature. Without examinations, students tend to ignore their studies. Moreover, the results of examinations are just like mirrors for both students and teachers. Students can assess themselves and teachers can adjust their teaching method according to the information they obtain from examination. Finally, till now no better methods have been discovered to replace examinations. Other forms of assessment are too time-consuming and therefore are infeasible.In my opinion, examinations have positive effects on teaching. They make students hardworking. They also provide a clear objective standard by which the students can assess themselves and teachers can know what they should do next. Furthermore, at present no better methods are available. Therefore, I am sure examinations will continue to play an essential role in education.",8
"In recent years, many young people decide to further their study abroad. Do you think the advantages of study abroad outweigh its disadvantages?","Over the last several years, along with the rapid development of economy, an increasing number of parents have been sending their children to study abroad. A majority of people hold the view that study abroad brings students many benefits, while others are of the opinion that students should finish university education in their motherland. It is quite natural that people from different backgrounds may have divergent attitudes towards it.People, who advocate that study abroad has a lot of disadvantages, have their sound reasons. First of all, living far away from home, students will suffer from loneliness and homesickness. Overseas students often feel disoriented and depressed for lack of adequate knowledge and understanding of the local customs and lifestyle. Secondly, many students do not want to return to their native country after graduation because most of them want to seek a more comfortable life and a brighter future overseas. This may result in a serious brain-drain and our country will inevitably incur a huge loss of talents.To this issue, some other people hold a different attitude, arguing that students should go abroad to study. To begin with, it can broaden the students' vision. They get a chance to experience a totally different culture. The knowledge of social customs acquired in the other countries helps them to become more open-minded. Next, there are academic advantages. Students can learn advanced science and technology. They receive a different education. The book resources are more up-to-date. The professors are aware of all the latest development in their fields. Therefore the standard of teaching is much higher Moreover, when they finish their study abroad, they will have more choices for their future career. All the above merits are conducive to their self-betterment and self-realization.For my part, I stand on the latter opinion that while overseas study has its drawbacks, the advantages are more obvious. It can broaden one's horizon. Students have easy access to the first-rate facilities and the latest development in science and technology. In addition when they finish their study, they have more job opportunities. Therefore, as long as it is financially feasible, an overseas education may do a person more good than harm.",7
Nowadays it is difficult for university graduates to find a job. Analyze the individual and social reason sand offer some solutions.,"The job market for college graduates is getting tighter and tighter. According to a survey, in2005 only 60 percent of college graduates found jobs. Why do college graduates find it increasingly difficult to get jobs? There are some personal and social reasons.Graduates themselves are responsible for the situation. Nowadays university students cannot concentrate on their studies. High technology brings them many interesting things which can easily attract their attention such as watching TV, surfing the Internet and playing games. They are addicted to these activities, totally neglecting their studies. In addition some graduates set too high salary standard and they are reluctant to seek a job in the less developed areas, where there are many opportunities for success and career development.Furthermore, there is no denying the fact that the students better equipped with practical knowledge are more competitive in job hunting, while those majoring in history, geography and the like have few job opportunities.Should students assume all the responsibility? There are some social reasons, one of which is the boom of college graduates. For example, in China, only half of high school graduates were admitted to colleges and universities in 1997, but in 2001 two-thirds of them entered colleges. Obviously we will experience a sharp increase in the number of college graduates. Moreover, the world economy is in depression, which makes the situation of job market worse than ever. Another reason is that there exist some unreasonable employment policies such as sexual discrimination and residence permit restriction.In order to solve the problem, college graduates should spend more time on their learning to improve their academic performance. They also need to have a moderate salary requirement. Meanwhile, the government should encourage the development of the economy to create more job opportunities to young people. All the unreasonable policies should be abolished.",8
"People attend college or university for many different reasons (for example, new experiences, career preparation,increased knowledge). Why do you think people attend college or university?","College is a place where students can gain more new knowledge and experience. Of course, different people have different reasons for attending college: some may want to further their study in college; some hope to find a good job while some others wish to exchange their present situation through studying in college. In my opinion, college study can be best defined as a preparation for one's future life.Firstly, students can gain new knowledge and experience from studying in college. Teachers and professors in college who possess not only abundant professional knowledge but also plentiful teaching experience will supply students with new knowledge and direct them to solve problems in reality. With their help, students can be equipped with knowledge in a specific area, which will pave the road for their future career.Secondly, students can learn how to arrange time efficiently. Before studying in college, their life may often be arranged by their parents, and their study by teachers. It is very different for them to live and study in college, because they will have to arrange their life and study by themselves. They have to decide things such as when to get up, when to play, and when to finish their assignment etc. This experience is of great importance for their work and life in the future.Thirdly, studying in college gives students an opportunity to live with others and learn to cooperate with others. Usually, people feel uncomfortable about living with strangers because of different habits and values. But in the long run, it will turn out good for them because in the process of forcing themselves to cooperate with others and solve problems together, they will learn to care for and understand other people. It is a preparation for students to cooperate with others in society.All in all, students can not only gain lots of new knowledge but also accumulate much more experience, such as how to arrange time and how to cooperate with other people. Therefore, college study serves as an important preparation for their future work and life.",8
Should the goal of college education be to ensure that the students find a good job or should it aim at cultivating the students' overall abilities?,"What should be the purpose of college education? No doubt, different people, or even different universities, may see it quite differently. As to me, I tend to support the view that it should aim at cultivating the students' overall abilities.First of all, social progress needs overall-developed college graduates in the long run. When we ask ourselves the question: What kind of college graduates does the society need?"" The answer is just too obvious: ones with a good command of the knowledge in their own fields of study, ones with a healthy body, ones with a healthy mentality, ones with good communication skills, ones with teamwork spirit, ones with creative, innovative ability or the ability for implemen-tation. What are all these things? Again, the answer is just simple: overall abilities.Second, an overall developed graduate would find a job more easily. You can ask around an employer of a certain enterprise: What type of employees do you wish to employ? If this question is a little unclear, we can make it more specific by letting him make a choice: A.an overall developed college graduate; B. a none-overall developed college graduate. Sup-posing every other things remain equal, we have sound reasons to believe that he will definitely select A. Admittedly, it is praiseworthy of universities to be concerned about their graduates' job-hunt-ing issues, for anyone should first solve the problem of making a living before talking about later on development. Besides, it is also the shared aspiration of all college graduates to have a well-paid job that they like and that points to a good prospect in the future. However, no one would ever deny the fact that to cultivate the overall abilities of the students is always closely related to and in no way conflicts or contradicts good job opportunities.From the foregoing discussion, we can come to the conclusion that the purpose of college education should always target at cultivating the overall abilities of the students.""",8
Some people think that studying in a college or university is the best way for students to prepare for future career. But others think they should leave school as soon as possible to develop their career through work experience. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"While some people think that the best way to get prepared for future career is studying in a college or university, there are others who hold that one should leave school as early as possible and develop his career through work experience. In this essay, I will discuss the two views from the following aspects.Firstly, going to college is very useful. One needs to learn and acquire a lot of fundamental and theoretical knowledge that will prove to be of practical significance in his future career development. In this respect, a college education can well serve as a means to the end. It is not hard to reckon that the theoretical and fundamental knowledge one acquires at college will at least help broaden his vision and horizon and thus give him the edge over those who have not done so.Secondly, one's success, especially financial success, is not determined by whether or not he has been educated in college. It seems that work experience and opportunity play a more important role. I have quite a few friends who merely managed to finish primary or junior high school and went into business right away. Some of them struck rich in a few years and are now managing very large companies which employ over 1,000 workers, most of their employees being college graduates.However, our society is undergoing fast development and changes, thus raising higher and higher requirements for knowledge. In this context, people's education levels gradually reveal their corresponding advantages and disadvantages. So far as employment is concerned those who have received a college education naturally have more chances than those who have not. And in terms of the new models of achieving success, tremendous fortune is in-creasingly related to the trend of scientific and technological development, fully demonstrat-ing the value of going to college.So, even though there are quite some success stories of people without a college education we can assert from the development trend of the world that this will become rarer and rarer. Therefore, if one has the chance, it is more advisable for him to go to college.",8
Some people believe that students who want to go to university after graduation from high school should have about one year's time to get a job to obtain work experience or have a travel to enlarge their vision. Do you agree or disagree? What's your opinion?,"In most countries, most high school graduates go directly to university. Some people oppose this practice. They claim that students should get a job or have a travel for one year before starting their university education. They argue that, by this way, students can obtain work experience and their sights can be enlarged. However, I doubt whether the arguments could hold much water.First, it is a waste of time. Since students are in their formative years, the main task of students is to study hard and learn what is needed for the development of our nation. The knowledge and skills which they have gained in high school are surely inadequate.Compared with studying, working and traveling, to some extent, are more relaxing and less painstaking, so after one-year exciting experience outside campus, some young people tend to give up their learning. At least, they cannot concentrate on their studies. It is a great loss to themselves as well as a great misfortune for our country.Second, young students may be hurt psychologically. The job or the trip may expose them to social ills at an age when they cannot differentiate good from bad. Their early contact with the complicated society makes them more easily contaminated by unwholesome influence. For example, they maybe become money-oriented.Finally, studying in university can also enrich their social experience and widen their vision. The university is a small society so university students have to communicate with teachers, peers and other people and they have to deal with some problems. During holidays, they can find part-time jobs and go out to travel.In conclusion, students should continue their studying after graduation from high school. Social experience can be gained after finishing their studies.",7
Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students. Which view do you agree with?,"There is no denying that a college or university education is very beneficial. Those who receive higher education have more opportunities. They often hold better jobs, earn a higher income and enjoy a more comfortable and secure lifestyle. Unfortunately, places in university are often limited and reserved for good"" students. It is my belief that this practice is not only detrimental to those ""bad"" students, but to the society as a whole. Therefore, higher education should be available to all students.One reason that higher education should not be limited to good students is that not all secondary students study in equal circumstances. The facilities and teaching at some high schools are superior to those at others, and the students who study there enjoy a great advantage. In addition, a student's performance can be affected by his or her home environment or family financial pressure. It is often more difficult for a student from a disadvantaged environment and school district to perform well. However, this does not mean that the students would not appreciate and benefit from higher education if given the opportunity.Another reason for making higher education available to all is to encourage less capable students to improve. If marginal students believe that they have no hope of entering university, they may feel that there is no point in studying diligently. However, if they see a more direct relationship between their academic performance and their future opportunities, they will be more motivated. In this way, a poor student may turn out to be a good one.Finally, a better educated population contributes to the growth and prosperity of a society as a whole. For this reason, it is advantageous to educate as many young people as possible. Furthermore, by denying higher education to students who do not make their mark in their secondary education, the country may be ignoring a future Einstein. When every person in the society is given the opportunity to reach his or her full potential, the society will benefit.For all of these reasons, I believe that higher education should be available to all students, not only to those with good academic performance in high school. Of course, it is desirable to encourage good performance in students. This can be done by offering financial support in the form of scholarships to those who work hard. In this way, we can ensure that students have the ability to take advantage of the opportunities available to them.""",8
"Who should be more responsible for children's education, the school or the parents?","Recently, parents tend to attach greater importance to their children's education. Some parents hold the opinion that the school has the main duty to educate their children. However, some teachers take the view that parents should also assume the responsibility. Views on this issue vary from person to person.People who hold the opinion that the school should shoulder the major responsibility to educate children have some sound reasons. In the first place, most of the children's waking time is spent in schools, and their purpose to attend school is to receive education. Secondly, the parents of the children pay for the education of their children, so they have the rights to receive correspondent services. As an institution of education, the school has the sole responsibility to educate the younger generation. Moreover, there are well-equipped facilities and well-trained teachers in schools.However, the other side of the coin voices its strong opposition, saying that the parents should assume the main duty of children's education. First of all, the parents know their children more than the school, and they know what to teach and in what way it can be accepted. In the second place, it is beneficial to teach children in accordance with their specific features. Furthermore, in school, each child gets inadequate individual attention, and sometimes his or her particular needs are passed over.Admittedly, there are merits to both arguments. From my own perspective, I would like to take a more balanced position. Schools and parents are both essential to children's all-around development and they should take the responsibility together.",7
"Some people think young children can have better education in a boarding school far from home, while others claim that a day school is a better one. What's your opinion? Give your reasons.","When asked what kind of school, a boarding or day school or home, is better for young children's education, some people think a boarding school is more desirable while some prefer a day school or home.Those for a boarding school are justified, I think, in holding that children can learn to be in-dependent earlier when they are far away from home at an early age. Being away from home, young children are less likely to be spoiled by their parents or grandparents. They have to care for themselves, like washing clothes, buying necessities of life etc. They also think that living in a boarding school, together with people of the same age, is greatly beneficial to the building-up of children's personality. Young children can learn what cannot be learned at home, such as getting on well with others, the idea of cooperation, collectivism, and caring for others.However, those for a day school think quite the opposite. They argue that family education is also very important in addition to school education because family care and love amount to much in the development of children's personality, particularly in their childhood. There will be some psychological defects in a person, like being indifferent, unsociable, and cruel, if he does not enjoy enough family care and parental love during the formation of his character. The second reason is that young children need parents' supervision and guidance because they are still not mature enough to restrain themselves. Although teachers play apart, they can not spare enough attention for each student.As far as I am concerned, I think there is truth in the arguments of these two parties. I would like to have a balanced view—a day school and home living are good for children in their childhood. When they are old enough to go to high school, it will be more desirable for them to go to a boarding school.",8
Nowadays there are two kinds of school: public and private. Discuss the merits of each.,"These days, there is a growing tendency for students to enter private schools. A large number of people hold the opinion that private schools play a more important role in education than public schools. Other people, however, hold the opinion that public schools offer their children more advantages. For my part, I think both public schools and private schools are indispensable to our society.On one hand, it is increasingly acknowledged that private schools, with their unique characteristics can provide their students with more practical skills, which makes the more competitive in the job market. Generally speaking, a private school is renowned for certain fields of study, such as law or medicine in which many eminent authorities serve as tutors. In general, private schools, financed mainly through contributions and high tuition fees, have plenty of funds to invest in advanced teaching facilities, which can make the students' lives and studies more convenient and comfortable. But, at the same time, high tuition fees are an obstacle for gifted but poor students.On the other hand, the great contributions of public schools cannot be ignored. Poor students have easier access to the public schools that are supported by the government. Schools, ideally, should provide profound, systematic learning of various subjects. The public school that provides wide-ranging subjects for the students is ideal for such training. Furthermore, since education is being more and more emphasized nowadays, the government will, undoubtedly, invest more money in public schools.From what has been discussed above, we may safely draw the conclusion that both public schools and private schools are necessary to train young people for our country's development and construction.",8
"Students at universities often have a choice of places to live. They may choose to live in university dormitories, or they may choose to live in apartments in the community. Compare the advantages of living in university housing with the advantages of living in an apartment in the community. Where would you prefer to live?","At most universities there is a variety of housing options for students to choose from. Two of the most common ones are university dormitories and off-campus apartments. Each of these options has its advantages, so students should make their decision carefully.When moving into a university dormitory, students will find the following advantages. First, it is usually located on the campus and so it is very convenient for students to get to their classes, the library, and other university facilities. They will save the time that they would have otherwise spent commuting to campus. Second, living in a campus dormitory offers students a convenient life. They do not have to worry about cooking meals or paying utility bills on time because all these services are included. They will be able to devote more time to their studies and extracurricular activities. Finally, living in a dormitory makes it easy for students to meet others and develop friendships. In addition to sharing living and recreation space, students can meet others through activities organized by the university or the dormitory itself. This is especially helpful to new students.As for off-campus apartments, there are also several advantages. First of all, living away from the university allows students to develop more independence. Having more responsibility for their daily needs when they are students, they may find it easier to adjust to life on their own after graduation. In addition, the more independent lifestyle offers more freedom. Without university restrictions, the students can keep their own hours and set their own limits. Finally, students who live off-campus have more personal space. They do not have to share their bedrooms or bathrooms with many other people. This may allow them to better relax when they are not in class.In conclusion, both university dormitories and off-campus apartments offer certain advan-tages to students. Which one to choose depends on what is important to the student. As for me, I would choose to live in a university dormitory for the first year. This would allow me to make friends and get accustomed to school life without the distraction of having to worry about my daily needs. Later, I would move into an off-campus apartment in order to develop my independence and enjoy a freer lifestyle.",8
Is it better for students to live at home with their parents or in school accommodations? Give your own opinion on the issue. Use your own experience or an example to support your idea.,"Many parents would like to spend more money sending their children to boarding schools so that they can receive a better education. However, there are many others who prefer to let their kids stay at home. In my point of view, it is better for students to live in school accommodations.In the first place, living in school accommodations can cultivate students' ability to live independently. Students have to deal with many problems when they live on campus, such as learning how to adapt to a new environment and how to get along with other people. For instance, I began to live in boarding school since high school. Though at first I found it difficult to live alone, I gradually became open-minded and understood how to solve different problems on my own. These benefited me a lot in my later career life. I acquired many interpersonal communication skills and knowledge through living in school.Furthermore, living on campus can broaden our vision and horizon. Living in school accommodations, we are closer to many other students coming from various parts of the country and with diversified cultural backgrounds. Communicating with them enables us to learn from one another and make progress together. Unavoidably, we will be faced with some different opinions. Nevertheless, it is these counterviews that make us learn more.Of course, everything has two sides. Likewise, living in school also has its drawbacks. For example, students will have to be confronted with many psychological problems, for they often feel lonely and helpless in a new environment.However, these experiences may be something beneficial to their future development. Therefore, living in school has more advantages than living at home with parents.",8
It is much easier to learn in a small class than in a large one. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Use specific examples and reasons to support your answer.,"People's views on the size of a class vary. While some people hold that a small class is better for learning, there are others who argue that a big one is better. On a personal note, I am convinced that a small class is better for learning.In the first place, with a small number of students in one class, the classroom atmosphere would be relatively quiet and, therefore, it would be possible for students to concentrate on their learning. This can be easily understood, for, after all, the noise made by 10 or 20people is much lower than that made by 100 or even 200 people!Also, with fewer students, the teacher would find it much easier to manipulate the class, that is, to have the whole class under complete control. If there are too many students, the teacher would be at a loss as to what to do because controlling the situation itself would be challenging enough.Besides, in a small class, the students could have more interactive activities with the teacher and the teacher can give each student whatever instructions or help that he or she needs. When the number of students in a class is much too big, one-to-one or one-to-several tu-toring is simply impossible.From the above discussion, we can safely come to the conclusion that the size of a class does have much influence on the students' learning effect. A small class is better for learning.",7
"Many young people find their first days at high school or college difficult, because they feel very lonely.What do you think are the other difficulties they face on their first days? What can schools and colleges do to make them feel more comfortable?","For many teenagers, dealing with their first days at a new school not only means encountering many exciting new things, but also means overcoming difficulties. They maybe[d2] delighted to start pursuing more advanced study, another step towards their future success. But on the other hand, unpleasant sentiments, including loneliness, might hit them, when they have to work under the huge psychological pressure of adjusting to a new life of study.Part of the difficulties they face over this period is due to a changed academic environment. When proceeding to a university or a new school overseas, a student may face a different set of academic norms and expectations. The differences are significant enough to require adjustments in their learning style and attitudes to knowledge, when difficulties arise. Challenges also come from their peers. To ensure that their study performance is equal to or better than their fellow students, they need to work very hard, under great psychological pressure.However, there are more problems when they commence their new school life. For many students, this may be their first foray beyond the borders of the family home, perhaps living in another city or country. It may take them time to acclimatize and adapt, and local food might not suit their tastes. Sharing accommodation, they may not be able to get along well with other fellow students and suffer from the strain related to interpersonal relationships with relative strangers. To make matters worse, these new students are likely to find it hard to get used to and blend into the local culture, especially in the case of overseas students. In short, lack of familiarity adds to their homesickness, making them even more uncomfortable.School authorities may play an important role in helping students to settle in. First of all, the orientation programs could last long enough to enable students to feel at home. Furthermore, such programs should be on a more individual basis so that new students can get a clearer picture of school rules and facilities, in addition to accommodating special needs of particular students. Moreover, it would be a good idea for schools to organize some excursions and outings during the first days. Such activities would give students a better understanding of the local culture, as well as promoting better mutual understanding between peers.",8
"It is often said that the subjects in schools are too academic and that it would be more useful for children to learn about practical matters such as home management, work and interpersonal skills. Do you agree or disagree?","A criticism often heard these days is that the subjects taught in schools tend to be too academic, and contribute little to preparing a young person for the real-life tasks he or she will have to perform after graduation. They say that academic subjects are rooted in the past, and are not useful for solving modern problems. I disagree with this point of view for three reasons.My first reason is that it is the duty of parents, not teachers, to prepare their children to deal with the practical affairs of life. The home, not the classroom, is the ideal place to learn about home management and interpersonal skills. As for work abilities and attitudes, they are best learned on the job and under the supervision of an experienced older worker.My second reason is that academic subjects have withstood the test of time. They represent the accumulated wisdom of our ancestors down through the ages, and, far from being impractical, they equip us with the knowledge and confidence to make sound judgments about any problems which may crop up. In addition, academic subjects are good for train-ing us in mental discipline, while practical subjects are weak in this regard.My third reason is based on the saying Man does not live by bread alone."" School days devoted solely to instruction in down-to-earth practical matters would be dull indeed. Lessons in the best literature of the world and the epoch-making scientific and geographical discoveries of the past enrich our lives and make us feel that we are part of the great family of mankind.All in all, the teaching of academic subjects in schools is entirely appropriate. It is my firmly held view that practical subjects have no place in the classroom. On the contrary, the curriculum should be more academic.""",8
College students should give priority to practical courses over traditional ones?,"I frown when I hear people suggest that job-oriented programs should get a bigger share than traditional ones in curriculums of tertiary educational institutions in the hope that graduates can get easy access to employment. In my opinion, their view is short-sighted and flawed. Indeed, equal attention should be paid to both academic excellence and preparation for a working life.Every subject performs a unique and important role in a student's personal and mental development. It is true that practical courses like computer science and business courses are very useful and students who are adept at them will have a unique advantage in seeking a job. However, if they know nothing beyond these job-oriented skills, they will become robots rather than human beings. As a result, nations, in the long run, will lose their cultural identities.In fact, knowledge of history and geography is an integral part of human beings' overall qualities. This knowledge, which may seem less practical, is fundamental and necessary to shape students as useful members of society. For example, history teaches people about the development of their country, thus establishing a sense of national identity and pride. People with a knowledge of geography are generally more environmentally conscious, which, in the long run, is essential to achieving sustainable economic development and ensuring the survival of human beings.In fact, without the benefit of knowledge of history and geography, students cannot do well in learning practical courses either. Students pursuing business courses will be involved in cross-cultural communication. When promoting their products in foreign markets, knowing the local culture, history and geography is a key for them to work out a successful marketing strategy.A graduate with a wide range of knowledge besides his specialized and practical skills will get on better in society, and such a society will better off as a result. For these reasons, traditional courses deserve at least equal attention as practical ones.",8
"Some people think that the university should not provide theoretical knowledge, but to give practical training. Do you agree or disagree? Use your own experience and knowledge to support your idea.","Whether theory and practice are contradictory to each other has long since been a controversial issue and is still unresolved. Some people claim that university should not provide theoretical knowledge but to give practical training, which sounds unreasonable and even ridiculous to me. What my viewpoint towards this issue is that university should function as a comprehensive academic institution which can provide both theoretical knowledge and practical training.At first, I would like to point out that university is an intermediate stage where the graduates from high school prepare themselves for their future in society. As we all know, high schools focus relatively more emphasis on elementary education, which means the teaching in high schools is based on theoretical knowledge instead of practical training. Provided the university only attaches importance to the practical training, how can the college students adjust themselves to society and make contributions later without learning about applying theory into practice?Secondly, theoretical knowledge has settled foundation for practical training which serves as essentially as a cornerstone. The latter will not even be able to exist without the former one's guiding and directing. Take my own experience for example. When I was a freshman in university, I was offered a part-time job as a proofreader in a press. I accepted it without any hesitation considering it to be an extremely rare and valuable opportunity for practical training. Less than two weeks later I was dismissed by the chief editor who was mainly in charge of proofreading. The reason is simply that I was not qualified for the job due to lack of some correspondent theoretical knowledge.Thirdly, theoretical knowledge itself derives from practice via a demanding and sophisticated course of refining and abstracting. To provide proper amount of theoretical knowledge can consequently save money as well as time which are supposed to be devoted to practical training.In general, I stand my position that university ought not to replace theoretical knowledge teaching with practical training. Instead, we should attach the same importance to both aspects.",8
Some people think the students should take the subjects which are decided by the government in the university. Others think that students can apply for the subjects they prefer. Discuss the two situations and give your opinion.,"Some people hold that college students are supposed to study imperative courses assigned by the government while others argue that they should be endowed with the right to select whatever subjects appealing to their own interest. As far as I'm concerned, I side with the latter viewpoint and will demonstrate it in the following aspects.First and foremost, it is the basic human right to make personal choices, including what to study on campus, as schools are mere places for receiving education rather than military camps forcing people to accept everything imposed on them. Students, despite the fact that they just step into adulthood and may thus be inexperienced, actually don't need the government to confine them to a tiny little framework of knowledge. As an independent university student, one is both supposed to and able to apply for any subject he's keen on and shoulders all responsibilities for the decision.In the second place, each individual is distinctive, meaning that one doubtlessly has his own aptitudes as well as weaknesses. As is known to all, one man's meat could be another's poison.Therefore, the government should be sensible enough to entitle every single student to design or at least decide on his own curriculum according to his specific learning styles and preferences. It would have been a total catastrophe to have forced Beethoven to major in math and Einstein to work on opera.Every coin has two sides. Admittedly, there are still a few merits for students to take subjects determined by the government. For instance, students can better comprehend and pursue the latest trend of the country's cultural orientations, if they want to. What's more, they can lead a relatively easier academic life simply by following what is already prepared for them by the government. However, as we can clearly notify that these incentives are just for the sake of convenience.To sum up, to select subjects at one's own will contributes more to students' all-round development and it conforms more closely to human nature as well.",8
"It has been said ,""Not everything that is learned is contained in books .""Compare and contrast knowledge gained from experience with knowledge gained from books. In your opinion, which source is more important?","People always are learning and practicing through their whole lives. From reading words in textbook such as toy, car etc., people develop concepts and ideas. They further understand the actual meaning of these words by playing toys and riding cars etc. Education (books) and experience are the two main channels for people to gain their knowledge. Each plays a different role for people. In my opinion, knowledge from experience is more important than that from books.Experience firstly can prove whether the knowledge from books is true or false. Textbooks are very wonderful in teaching people essential principles. However, people can only understand the real meaning of those from books and justify them if they are right through practices. A few hundred years ago, people learnt from textbooks that the earth was flat. However navigators found that was wrong through observations and voyage.Knowledge from experience can improve and advance the world and our society. As books have limitations, they only teach us about what people found in the past. The knowledge from the books is constrained to the certain conditions and environment. For example, the university course only taught me very simple cases. Most knowledge I possess is obtained from various difficult and complicated cases in my career. There are a lot of new inventions and new products, which could not be found yet in textbooks. Our society and world are developed through continuous practices. Some knowledge, never found in books, such as internet, e-business etc. are all developed through new practices.The truth comes from practices and experience"", so goes an old saying. People are continually discovering new things and assessing the credibility of knowledge written in books. The knowledge from experience helps us much more than that from books.""",8
Some people believe that the best way of learning about life is by listening to the advice of family and friends. Other people believe that the best way of learning about life is through personal experience .Compare the advantages of these two different ways of learning about life. Which do you think is preferable?,"As we grow, we learn many things about life. Some of these lessons are easy and some are difficult. What is the best way to learn them? Some believe that they can learn best by listening to the advice of others, while some people believe that it is better to learn through personal experience. Both methods have their advantages.In the first case, learning by listening to others, we have the benefit of learning from others' mistakes and are thus being able to avoid them ourselves. We can take advantage of the experience and wisdom of our friends and family. This will help us to make better decisions and avoid costly errors. Furthermore, the people who know us well can advise us effectively because they understand our strengths and weaknesses. At the same time, they are sometimes able to see situations more objectively than we are.In the second case, learning through doing, we have the advantage of gaining meaningful experience. We will no doubt better remember the lessons we learn when we enjoy their wards or suffer the consequences ourselves. Moreover, we can often develop other skills through personal experience and can learn from our mistakes. Finally, no two people are exactly alike. Therefore, what family and friends think may be suitable for them, but not appropriate for us.Given a choice between these two ways of learning about life, I would still choose the former, learning through the advice of others. This is because I believe I should take advantage of all the resources available, and the experiences of my family and friends area valuable resource. For example, if I were preparing to take my first trip abroad on my own, the advice of others who have already experienced such a trip could only help me. Just as we can learn from history, we can learn from the past actions of those close to us.",8
"Which is more important for you in your life: knowledge from books you read, or personal experiences in reality? Please use details to explain your answer.","Books and experience are the main two channels for people to gain their knowledge. Each plays different roles for people. In my opinion, knowledge from experience is more important than that from books.To begin with, experience can prove if the knowledge from books is true or false. Textbooks are very wonderful in teaching people essential principles. How does the world look like? What is the basic law of change of people and things? We can learn a lot through primary school, secondary school until university. However, people can only understand the really meaning of those from books and justify them if they are right through practices.

Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with?,"Some people may believe that going to classes should be optional, but I disagree. I don't understand how university students can expect to learn anything if they don't attend classes. Personal experience can help people learn about themselves and the world outside the classroom, but when it comes to learning about academic subjects, students need to be in class.In class they receive the benefit of the teacher's knowledge. The best teachers can do more than just go over the material in the textbook. They draw their students into discussion on the material. They present opposing points of view. They schedule guest speakers to come, give the students additional information, or show documentary films on the subject.Also classes on any subject provide more than just facts. The students are taught how to learn, how to get information and then apply what they've learned in other situations. Their teacher is the best one to help them with these skills. They can't learn them just by reading the textbook.By going to class, the students can learn how to work with the other members of the class. Many times, students will be given group assignments. This is different from what they did in secondary school. Here they are with people from different backgrounds and experiences. In this situation, they learn how to cooperate with people different from themselves to achieve a common good.In short, by going to class, students get more than just information from the teacher. They also learn how to learn, how to work with others, and how to work responsibly. These are not optional skills in life, so attending classes should not be optional.",8
"Some people think that, in order to improve the quality of education, students should be encouraged to evaluate and criticize their teachers. Others feel that this will result in a loss of respect and discipline in the classroom. What do you think?","In many universities, students are asked to evaluate their teachers after each course. Some people believe the system has many advantages to the students and the teachers. Others argue that it would lead to poor discipline in the classroom. Indeed, evaluation of their teachers by students has both pros and cons.There are many drawbacks in student assessment. First of all, students are very young and, compared with their teachers, are less knowledgeable both in theory and practice on a subject. Therefore, they are unable to evaluate their teachers' performance in a sound way. Secondly, student assessment would lead to poor discipline in the classroom. If each of the students is allowed to decide on what, how and when to learn, class room management would become impossible. Thirdly, in order to gain a better evaluation, teachers would seek to please each of the students by lowering the study requirements. This would do harm to students' academic performance in the long run.However, advocates of student assessment have their reasons. Firstly, this kind of feedback can be used to improve teachers' performance. Teaching methods can only be successful if they are student-centered. Therefore, listening to the students' constructive suggestions, teachers will have a better idea of what students' needs are and can then adjust their teaching to meet them. Secondly, the process of writing evaluations will help the students think in their own way independently. Students should be encouraged to learn by even challenging their teachers' thinking. Thirdly, the matter could be considered in a commercial way. Teachers are those who provide paid educational services while students, paying for their education, are customers. In this way, it can be fully justified that students have the right to evaluate the services they receive.In my own opinion, student evaluations of teachers would be beneficial to both teachers and students. Teachers can adjust their teaching according to the information they obtain from the evaluation. Students' ability of independent thinking and learning can be greatly improved. Moreover, the practice is the outcome of market economy. Students have rights to evaluate their teachers.",8
"Nowadays, we can learn from computers and we can also learn from human teachers. What do you think are the advantages and disadvantages of these two kinds of ""teachers""?","People's view on the advantages and disadvantages of learning from computers and from human teachers vary from person to person. While some people believe that learning from computers is more convenient and more economical than learning from human teacher, there are others who hold that learning with the help of human teachers can ensure better learning effect. On a personal note, I argue that these two approaches both have positive and negative aspects and thereby a combination of these two approaches of learning is the best policy.First, nowadays with the development of computer science, we use computers almost in every aspect of our life, especially in education. Some people predict that one day computer will take the place of human teacher. Is that true? It is true that it is both convenient and economical to learn this way. For example, we can listen to online lectures without leaving our homes and can stop at any time we want. We can also take free courses on the Internet.But we also have to admit that if we have doubts and problems while we are listening to the on-line lecture, which is sure to happen from time to time, no one can help us out right away. To solve this problem, what we need to do is perhaps to send e-mails and then wait for the reply for days or even for weeks. However, we don't have to face such problems if we learn from human teachers as they can help us out at once. Also, they can adjust their teaching process according to how well we can follow them, that is, they can adapt their teaching methods to suit our actual levels.While learning from human teachers does possess many an advantage, it is also a fact that we will have to go to school every day and in so doing, we will have to spend a lot of time traveling to and from schools, thus suffering from traffic jams and all the kinds of inconveniences.As a whole, both computer teachers and human teachers have their advantages and disadvantages in their own special and unique way. Therefore, I'm sure they will exist side by side in the future. This means that it is most advisable for us to combine these two ways of learning.",8
Some people think that they can learn better by themselves than with a teacher. Others think that it is always better to have a teacher. Which do you prefer?,"I would argue in this essay that learning from teachers is more advisable in that with the help of teachers, we can learn faster and learn in a more enjoyable manner.First of all, learning from teachers can make sure that we learn more quickly. As we all know, teachers have received professional trainings which means that they are supposed to know much more than we do on a certain subject. Besides, they have rich experience which can help ensure that we learn more effectively and that we can quickly understand what we should understand. This will be hard to achieve if we learn by ourselves, for, after all, both our knowledge and ability to solve problems are limited; otherwise, we would not need teachers at all.Second, it is more fun to learn from teachers. As we know, learning is a long process which requires a lot of patience and endurance to be carried on. This naturally poses a great challenge to us all: how can we make it? The answer is simple: to develop interest. As the saying goes, Interest is the best teacher."" With interest, we would feel that learning, which used to be so boring, suddenly becomes so much fun and thus we are happy and self-motivated to learn. To do this is nothing easy because the entire process of learning is full of hardships and despairs. However, our teachers are capable of making their class teaching lively and interesting which in turn, can greatly arouse our passion and enthusiasm for learning and finally enable us to find fun in it, thus carrying it on and on.Based on the above discussion, we see that learning under the guidance of teachers can make the learning process itself easier and more enjoyable.""",8
Some people think that teachers should be responsible for teaching students how to judge right and wrong and how to behave well. Some say that teachers should only teach students about academic subjects. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"There is no denying that a teacher's role in the overall development of a student is multifaceted. As a teacher, one's primary obligation is to teach students academic knowledge. Yet, it is equally important for him to make sure that the students make progress in other aspects.First of all, whether one can effectively pass academic knowledge to the students makes the first and most important criterion for judging him as a qualified or unqualified teacher. The main task for the students to perform at school is to lay a solid foundation for their study at a higher level, thus the task for a teacher is to assist them to achieve this goal.Second, a teacher's obligation is not just confined to passing on academic knowledge to the students. The students are also supposed to develop their ability to judge right from wrong, thus becoming good citizens when they step out of school. To do this, a teacher will have more roles to play than just teaching academic subjects. He will have to set a good example of morality himself and share or discuss with his students his viewpoints towards different phenomena in society. In a sense, apart from the role as a pure academic teacher, he also serves the roles of students' parents at school.Admittedly, a teacher can relatively be more sure about the academic progress of the students, but not that sure about their moral development for the simple reason that society is a big dyeing pool in which one's being dyed into a certain colour is the result of many factors of which family and many other things also have a role to play. Therefore, seen from this perspective, the influence of a teacher is, after all, limited.From the above discussion, we can come to the conclusion that apart from teaching students academic subjects, a teacher should also try his best to mould their personality and moral image. Meanwhile, the society as a whole is also supposed to work together to ensure the students' overall development.",8
Should students wear school uniforms? What is your opinion?,"It is a common practice for schools to require their students to wear school uniforms. It is very understandable that school authorities carry out such a policy, because it obviously benefits not only schools but also their students.Schools are the places where students receive formal education. A sound study environment can contribute to students' satisfactory study performance. To require students to be in school uniforms is part of a school's efforts to create a good learning environment.Wearing school uniforms is also seen to offer other benefits to students. An obvious one is to ease the financial burden for students. Being in school uniform from Monday to Friday means that there is almost no need for students to buy many other clothes to wear. Another potential advantage is the effect it may have on the students' personal development. School uniforms give children a sense of student identity and belonging to a particular school. Realizing this, students tend to work harder on their courses.One might argue that the requirement to wear uniforms may discourage individuality and creativity. As a matter of fact, such an argument is flawed. School uniforms of the same colour and design instill the notion that an organization has greater importance on value than an individual's creativity. In fact, in today's highly organized society, it is this view which should prevail.In conclusion, school uniforms play a significant role in encouraging the students to be hardworking and disciplined.",8
In some countries young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people to do this.,"It is quite common these days for young people in many countries to have a break from studying after graduating from high school. The trend is not restricted to rich students who have the money to travel, but is also evident among poorer students who choose to work and become economically independent for a period of time.The reason for this trend may involve the recognition that a young adult who passes directly from school to university is rather restricted in terms of general knowledge and experience of the world.By contrast, those who have spent some time earning a living or travelling to other places have a broader view of life and better personal resources to draw on. They tend to be more independent, which is a very important factor in academic study and research, as well as giving them an advantage in terms of coping with the challenges of student life.However, there are certainly dangers in taking time off at that important age. Young adults may end up never returning to their studies or finding it difficult to readapt to an academic environment.They may think that it is better to continue in a particular job, or to do something completely different from a university course. But overall, I think this is less likely today, when academic qualifications are essential for getting a reasonable career.My view is that young people should be encouraged to broaden their horizons. That is the best way for them to get a clear perspective of what they are hoping to do with their lives and why. Students with such a perspective are usually the most effective and motivated ones and taking a year off may be the best way to gain this.",8
"In many countries, students participate in some kind of paid work in their spare time. Some people think this is wrong, but others believe that such work will extend students' knowledge and increase their sense of responsibility. What is your opinion?","When it comes to whether children should be allowed to work outside school hours, some educators are strongly against it, claiming that part-time work may have a negative influence on their study. Obviously, if students spend too much time on employment, it may contribute to poor academic performance. However, if they do a part-time job over reasonable hours, it may be extremely valuable for them.One of the clear advantages is that they could finance part of their education from their own earnings, easing the financial burden on their parents. The extra money earned may enable them to get better access to various educational resources, such as books, stationery, special courses, and special-interest clubs. Using money of their own, they tend to value such opportunities more. In return, this will undoubtedly benefit them a great deal in their study.What matters even more is that when they do part-time jobs, they may learn something practical that they could never be taught at school. A student working part-time in a software company could keep himself well-informed about the latest software not even installed in his school's computer lab.Students in part-time employment would also stand a chance of being exposed to different types of people, thus helping them to become mature when dealing with interpersonal relationships. Let's take the example of a student working in sales. To sell products, the young person is constantly obliged to assess and satisfy the needs of his customers. By and by, he learns to be considerate in associating with other people. This must be very beneficial for his future success.In a word, students should be encouraged to take up part-time employment outside school hours.",8
"Some say part-time jobs are useful for full-time students, because they not only earn money but also gain career experience. Do you agree or disagree?","There is a growing tendency these days for students to take part-time jobs, even though they are following full-time higher-education courses. Many people criticize this on the grounds that working even part-time interferes with their studies and gives them little or no useful experience. Besides, they say, the little extra money they earn does not compensate for the fatigue incurred by working and studying at the same time.But it seems to me that working at a part-time job is useful for helping a student to learn how to arrange his or her time properly. We all must learn to plan our time so that we do not become absorbed in one single task, no matter how important it is. In later life, the student will have to be able to balance the demands of a career with the demands of his or her family, and at the same time handle various unexpected crises.As for the money earned from part-time jobs, I firmly believe that it is not only useful but also necessary nowadays for students to earn extra money, no matter how little. Tuition fees and the prices of books, not to mention the cost of living, are soaring by the day. As a result, sometimes even a small sum of extra money can make all the difference between passing or failing a course.To sum up, I agree that full-time students should take part-time jobs. Working while studying teaches the student good time-management habits. Most students need extra money, and if the jobs are chosen properly they can benefit not only the students' pockets, but also their health and studies as well.",8
"What do you imagine are the advantages and disadvantages of working abroad, as far as individuals and countries are concerned?","In an era of economic globalization, working abroad is emerging as an inevitable trend. A recent study has revealed that the number of people who are employed overseas across the world still keeps rising. What does this tendency imply for individuals and nations?Advantages can be expected from such an experience. Being exposed to different cultures, individuals can get a clear picture of the way other people live. Work experience overseas can also broaden one's horizons about the world and lead one to a more objective attitude toward it. This results from being able to view things in different ways and from different cultural angles. Ultimately, one could also become more tolerant. When this is the case for a great number of individuals, the collective impact may even produce less conflict and promote peace between countries. As far as nations suffering from overpopulation and high unemployment are concerned, another benefit from the trend of working abroad can be perceived, as it may ease employment pressure there. For countries that receive employees, the influx might satisfy the demand for lab our.However, in some cases, overseas employment may bring some undesirable consequences for individuals as well as nations involved. There is a likelihood of encountering language barriers and culture shock, when one finds oneself try to adapt to local customs and culture. Living overseas also means being away from one's family and, as a consequence, this weakens family ties. A good case in point is that a couple who live apart often ends up divorcing. In addition, because talented people prefer developed areas as their destinations, these places are more liable to become overcrowded with high-calibre experts. At the same time, the underdeveloped countries are in urgent need of such people.On the whole, I would say that the advantages of working overseas far outweigh its disadvantages.",8
"The idea of going overseas for university study is an exciting prospect for many people. But while it may offer some advantages, it is probably better to stay at home because of the difficulties a student inevitably encounters living and studying in a different culture. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","There is no doubt that going to study in a foreign country, with its different language and culture, can be a frustrating and sometimes painful experience. But while overseas study has its drawbacks, the difficulties are far outweighed by the advantages. Indeed, people who go abroad for study open themselves up to experiences that those who stay at home will never have.The most obvious advantage of overseas university study is real-life use of a different language. While a person can study a foreign language in his or her own country, it cannot compare with constant use of the language in academic and everyday life. There is no better opportunity to improve second-language skills than living in the country in which it is spoken. Moreover, having used the language during one's studies offers a distinct advantage when one is applying for jobs back home that require the language.On a campus, the foreign student is not alone in having come from far away. He or she will likely encounter many others from overseas and it is possible to make friends with people from all around the world. This is not only exciting on a social level, but could lead to important overseas contacts in later professional life.Finally, living and studying abroad offers one a new and different perspective of the world and, perhaps most importantly, of one's own country. Once beyond the initial shock of being in a new culture, the student slowly begins to get a meaningful understanding of the host society. On returning home, one inevitably sees one's own country in a new, often more appreciative angle.In conclusion, while any anxiety about going overseas for study is certainly understandable, it is important to remember that the benefits offered by the experience make it well worthwhile.",8
Studying English in an English-speaking country is the best but not the only way to learn the language. Do you agree?,"Studying a language in a country where it is widely spoken has many advantages. It is, therefore, a good idea to study English in a country such as Australia. However, I believe it is not the only way to learn the language.In the first place, most students in non-English speaking countries learn English at middle school, and some even at university nowadays. Although their spoken English is not usually of a very high standard, their knowledge of grammar is often quite advanced. This is certainly useful when students come to an English-speaking country to perfect the language.Secondly, studying the basics of English at secondary school is less stressful than learning the language while overseas. This is because students living at home do not have to worry about problems such as finding accommodation, paying for their study and living costs, and trying to survive in a foreign country where day-to-day living causes much stress.However, there are obvious advantages of learning English in Australia. Every day there are opportunities to practice listening to and speaking with Australians. Also, students can experience the culture first-hand, which is a great help when trying to understand the language. This is especially true if they choose to live with Australians, as part of a homestay family, for example. Furthermore, if students attend a language school full-time, the teachers will be native speakers. In this case, not only will students improve speaking and listening skills, but attention can be paid to developing reading and writing skills as well.In general, even though it is preferable to study English in an English-speaking country, a reasonable level of English can be achieved in one's own country, if a student is gifted and dedicated to study.",8
"In order to learn a language well, we should also learn about the country as well as the cultures and lifestyles of the people who speak it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","I fully support the assertion that to learn a language well, we should also be familiar with the country as well as the cultures and lifestyles of the people who speak it.Let's first see how we normally define learning a language really well"". To my understanding, learning a language well means being able to speak the language in a proper way. Here, with speaking it properly, we need to know that due to cultural differences, many things are just so different from culture to culture. For example, the Chinese often greet each other by asking ""Have you taken your meal?"" which, to the Western ears, would make an invitation to lunch or dinner. Therefore, the lack of a knowledge of the cultures of different countries will give rise to wrong interpretations of the message issued or received and as a result, lead to misunderstandings. In this way, we cannot say that we are speaking the language properly and further, we cannot say that we speak it well.Second, the ultimate purpose for us to learn a language is to use it in our communication with other people who speak it, mainly the native speakers. Suppose we know nothing about the US or Britain, including its government, its people, its tradition, and its other aspects. Do you think you can speak English properly, thus achieving effective communication with the American or British people? I'll say at least I can't.Third, the lifestyles of the people whose language we are learning are also something we need to know in order that we can speak their language properly. For instance, the Chinese eat pork, but this is not the case with Muslims. Also, Muslims are very religious people and perform rituals many times a day. If we don't know these things, how can we expect to communicate with them without incurring troubles? In this logic, if we cannot make sure that we are speaking their language properly, how can we say that we have learned their language well?From the above discussion, we finally draw the conclusion that to learn a language really well, we also need to be familiar with the country as well as the cultures and lifestyles of the people who speak it.""",8
Some people like different friends. Others like similar friends. Which kind of friend do you prefer? Explain why.,"Which kind of friends is more desirable, different friends or similar friends? Since people' s criterion for friendship differs, they may never agree on the above issue. Personally, I have made friends with people from all walks of life, and these different friendships are such a precious treasure for me.In the first place, a mixture of friends can bring us many practical benefits. As the saying goes, a friend in need is a friend indeed. Since we all need to move on in life, we need new friends to lead us to new adventures, new career opportunities and new life. In fact, most of us have to make new friends when we leave school and find employment. Besides, different friends can help us with the different difficulties that we encounter in life. And the friend in a foreign country might be able to arrange cheap accommodation for a holiday.In the second place, the contact with different friends gives us a broad outlook on life. As the Chinese sage Confucius put it, When three persons walk together, one of them can surely be my teacher."" Since we all have our own weaknesses, the strengths of different friends can always complement each other. For example, from a friend who majors in computer, I have learned how to design my own web page; by exchanging e-mails with an American pen-friend, I have greatly improved my English writing. In addition, different friends can help me to enjoy a variety of interests, and we can always attract each other with our different hobbies, different ideas and different experiences. I feel that I can always find new things to learn from my various different friends.All in all, although ""birds of a feather flock together,"" I would like to fly with ""birds"" of different feathers, which would certainly make my life more colourful.""",8
Most young people without a partner would prefer to have a boyfriend or girlfriend. Yet being in a relationship when you are young is not always a good idea. Do you agree or disagree?,"When you are young, there is often a great deal of peer pressure pushing you to be in a relationship. Although most young people spend a lot of time dreaming about finding the right boyfriend or girlfriend, I believe that early relationships can lead to many problems which young girls and boys might not be able to solve easily.Firstly, having a special friend is a large responsibility. It takes a lot of time to look after the needs and interests of another person. It could be better to spend the time studying or playing sport. After all, there will be plenty of opportunities for young people to share their lives later, when they are grown-up.Next, there is the financial situation to consider. Some activities are cheaper to do together, but most are not. Often one partner has more money than the other and has to pay for both when, for instance, they go to the movies or to a restaurant. Also, young people love to buy each other gifts, and may try to impress by spending more than necessary.Some people argue that today's youth are better informed than their parents were, and, therefore, might be more capable of making a relationship succeed. This may be true, but young people today still have many emotional problems to face; especially in a relationship it is more difficult. For instance, it is hard to have complete trust in someone without a strong commitment. Jealousy can be very destructive, especially at an early age.In general, while it is true that, for young people, being together and in love is wonderful, there are often many difficult issues to cope with in a full-time relationship.",8
Some people prefer to spend time with one or two close friends. Others choose to spend time with a large number of friends. Compare the advantages of each choice. Which of these two ways of spending time do you prefer?,"Friends play a very important part in everyone's life. And each of our friends is special and unique. Some friends may be good advisors or confidants while others challenge our opinions or push us to try something new. Therefore, we may like to pursue different activities with different friends, and we may like to be with a large group of friends or spend time with just one or two. Each has its advantages.One advantage of spending time with one or two close friends is that these friends usually know us well. We can communicate with them easily and are unembarrassed to share our feelings. We know that these good friends won't judge us. In addition, we are likely to share many of the same interests and will, therefore, find it easy to talk about many things. Finally, it is much simpler to arrange activities when only two or three people are involved.Spending time with large groups of friends also has its advantages. First, being with a wider variety of people exposes us to many more new ideas. We may be introduced to new things and develop new interests as a result. Also, we will be more likely to find someone to do things with when we associate with many friends. Last but not least, being with a large group of people can be fun and happy. There will always be enough people to play any game or make up a team.As for me, although it can be fun to spend time with a large group of friends, I prefer to stay with one or two close friends. It is easier for us to match our schedules and arrange a time to meet. Also, we have a deeper relationship, so I find the time that I spend with them to be very valuable. No matter how we like to spend time with friends, there is no denying that friends are very important to us.",8
Many problems in schools are aroused by the attitudes of students. How do these problems form? What should we do to change the situation?,"School violence becomes very protrusive in many countries, most of which are caused by the attitudes of students. Some governments and the authorities show great concerns about the problems. From my point of view, these problems are aroused by three factors, the development of society, the influence of family and media and the weakness of school education.The rapid development of the society offers young students more opportunities to contact the outside world. Due to the lack of social experience, some youngsters are not capable of distinguishing right from wrong. Curiosity drives them into imitating what they have seen on TV or from the people around them. Therefore, it is easy for them to be addicted to alcohol, smoking and drugs. Some students even smoke or take drugs at school.Family violence is another major factor causing problems in schools. Family violence hurts children both physically and psychologically. Physically, family violence will hurt their tender body because children are still in the stage of development. Psychologically, physical punishment will hurt children's self-confidence and make them have a tendency of violence. Recently, school gunshots hit the headlines frequently, which should be partly attributed to family violence.Finally, the weakness of school education is an important factor causing school problems. Some schools only stress students' achievements in their study, while neglecting their moral education. Therefore, even some top students are apt to stride on the criminal road.To solve these problems, I think we should take the following measures. Firstly, schools should strengthen students' moral education, giving them correct directions and cultivating their ability to tell right from wrong. Secondly, parents should spare some time to communicate with their children, resolving difficulties and troubles for them timely. If the school and family can join hands in solving these problems, I think the students will develop healthily and the environment in schools will become much clearer.",8
"As reading is important for a good education, we should encourage our children to read whatever appeals to them. Do you agree or disagree?","The famous English philosopher Francis Bacon said, Reading makes a full man"". Reading books can strongly shape you inclination, mature your thoughts, widen you horizon and enrich your personality. Life is limited, but knowledge is boundless. The more books we read, the more knowledge we get. Hence, we should encourage our children to read more books.However, books can also be harmful, particularly the pornographic books. Bad books always contain evil thoughts. In them, there might be much description about violence, superstition, and sex. Let's suppose that you are in the position of a parent. Would you allow your children to read whatever appeals to them? If your answer to the question is""yes"", you are either extremely permissive or just plain irresponsible. If children read bad books, the evil thoughts would poison their mind gradually. They will be dispirited and perhaps commit a crime.Good books, on the other hand, teach and help children to do good things. Good books are children's real companions, and they are both instructive and inspiring. Children know past events from history books, study communication by language book, learn space and numbers through mathematics books. In a word, different kinds of good books can give them a large amount of ideas and knowledge.Consequently, those who read good books can be inspired to grow healthily, while those who read bad ones will lead a wicked life and meet with miserable failure. So before we encourage our children to read books, we should teach and help them to identify good and bad books.""",8
Children learn best by observing the behaviour of adults and copying it. Do you agree or disagree?,"The process of growing up is very complex for children. Among countless factors that influence children's growth, the behaviour of adults plays a significant role in shaping children's inclination and character. After the baby is born, the first and the nearest adults are his/her parents. The little babies have started to learn from their parents by observing and copying the adults' talk. This learning environment is important for the babies.There is a special case reported by the press. A baby was abandoned when she was born.A sow fed her as a piglet. When she was about eight years old, some villagers found her, her intelligence was just similar to the two-year old baby and all of her behaviours were looked like a pig. From this case, we know child is a mirror"" which will reflect the behaviour of the closest adults.Along with the children's growth, adults will influence them much more, such as logical thinking, making a decision, cooperation with others, etc. The behaviour of adults can give children both good and bad influence. Most of the behaviours represent adults' inclination. For instance, if media report chiefly on the seamy side of the society, children will easily incline to violence and excessive sex. Therefore, they will be infected with bad mental state.Behaviour is a direct and convincing method to teach children. Things are easier said than done. Parents always tell children those principles repeatedly, but most children can not accept it through these boring method. Adults' behaviour is the most effective education method to let them observe the whole process of how to deal with the problems. The children will learn from the adults naturally.Children are like young trees, they need to be carefully irrigated, fertilized and trimmed. Adults' behaviour will be greatly helpful to shape them into useful talents.""",8
"Some people believe that children should engage in educational pursuits in their spare time, otherwise they are wasting their time. Do you agree or disagree?","Today, education has become a priority for many parents seeking to secure a good future for their children in this rapidly changing world. They believe that if their children apply themselves and work hard at school, then they will increase their opportunities to go for a higher education and eventually get a good job. Of course they are right, and as access to the best education and best job is becoming more competitive, then it is true that children have to make the best of their study time when they are young.However, the parents who do not allow their children sufficient free time for leisure activities outside school hours are misguided. Such activities are far from being a waste of time for the children simply because they are not academic. It is important to remember that children need to develop skills other than intellectual ones, and the best way to achieve this is through activities such as sports, games and playing with other kids. If they cannot play make-believe games, how can they develop their imagination? How can they learn physical co-ordination or learn important social lessons about the winning and losing if they do not practise any sports? Many children develop strong personal relationships with their friends they play with, and without the opportunity to this, they could grow up emotionally immature or unformed.Finally, I think it is also important to remember that children need to relax as well as work. If everything they do must have some educational or academic relevance, then they will soon get tired of studying altogether, which is the last thing parents would want.	8
High school students should remain in general schools until 17 years old. Only then can they know themselves enough to choose the specialty for their future career. Do you agree or disagree with the statement?	Some people think high school students should remain in general schools till 17 years old so that they are mature enough to know what speciality is suitable for their future careers.My opinion is identical with theirs.In the first place, the policy tallies with the psychological traits of an average teenager. An average person won't become mature enough until they reach the age of 17 or 18. Students at the age of 17 will have a better understanding about themselves. They learn to be responsible for what they decide.In the second place, staying in high schools for longer years helps student to enlarge their common knowledge before they choose their speciality, which enables them to discover their real interests and strong points. With longer years in high school, students may have more experience which helps to understand life and the society so that they may choose their speciality according to the demand of the society. As a result, they may avoided tours.Of course, I am not denying the merits of leaving high school earlier, before 17. Some people mature earlier not only psychological but intellectually. They may find quite inappropriate for them to remain in high school until 17. Those who leave high school earlier to receive higher education or pursue their careers will certainly possess an apparent advantage over others who don't. Therefore, we shall allow people to decide for themselves according to their specific condition.Frankly speaking, both views are well-grounded. However, if I have to choose one of these two, I am in favour of the first opinion that students should stay in general schools till 17, which can ensure a sound and solid foundation for all the students to further their study at the tertiary level or pursue their career.",8
"Some people think that old people should be taken care at home, while others think they should be placed in old people's house. What is your opinion?","Thanks to the development of medical science, there are an increasing number of elderly people in the world. Some people believe that the seniors should be looked after at home. Indeed, it is the children's responsibility and obligation to take care of their parents when they are old. However, as for me, a better way to ensure them to live a happy life is to send them to the nursing home.First of all, in such retirement homes, aging people can receive intensive medical care from professional doctors. Besides, they can receive a proper diet prepared by dieticians to meet their individual requirements. This is especially good for those old people in poor health. Moreover, they could have regular medical check-ups so that any disease could be diagnosed in its early stage. What is the most beneficial is that if any disease strikes them, medical services are immediately available.Living in nursing homes, they have more opportunities to communicate with their peers. They do not feel lonely and can do a great deal of things together, such as doing morning exercise, playing games, and exchanging memories and stories from their past. On the contrary, if they live at home, they are often left alone when their children and grandchildren are away working or studying.Some people may say that children have duties to take care of their old parents. However, nowadays people are confronted with fierce competition and suffer from great pressure. They are too occupied to spare time for their old parents. There are benefits for children's work and study when nursing homes take over the task of caring for the elderly. Children, free from care, can devote themselves to work or study and achieve more success.Since nursing homes benefit seniors and other family members so much, I believe that old people should be sent to nursing homes.",8
Some people think that children do not get as much attention from their parents as children did in the past. To what extent do you agree or disagree with the opinion?,"In recent years, many parents have little time for their children. Some people are of the opinion that children do not get as much attention from their parents as children did in the past. On the other hand, towards the same issue, other people have a different attitude. Before giving my opinion, I think it is important to look at the argument on both sides.There are several reasons which suggest that children do not get as much attention from their parents as children did in the past. On one hand, people face fierce competition and suffer from great pressure. They have to devote more time and energy to their careers and therefore have no time with their children. On the other hand, high technology brings them more interesting things which can easily attract their attention such as watching TV, surfing the Internet and playing games. They are addicted to these activities, totally ignoring their children. More importantly, the record of divorce rate has been constantly renewed. Obviously, children from broken family get less care and attention from their parents.However, there are a large number of people who hold a different view concerning this case. They believe that children gain more attention from their parents than children did in the past. For one thing, with the development of technology, more and more machines replace men's labour. Therefore, people enjoy more and more free time at home with their children. For another, with the development of economy, people earn more money. Some parents even give up their decent job and devote all their energy to their children. Last but not least, there is a sharp decrease in the number of children a family has. Consequently, each child gets more attention and care from their parents.Both opinions make sense, and consequently it is hard to decide which one is more reasonable. From my own perspective, children get more attention from their parents than children did in the past. Parents spend more time with their children. They have more money to ensure their children's needs. In addition, the number of children decreases dramatically.",7
It is generally acknowledged that the relationship among family members is not as close as it used to be. Give possible reasons and your recommendations.,"Nowadays, couples quarrel more often than they used to do. Brothers and sisters talk less and take less care of each other. Children turn less to their parents for advice. These scenes are just part of the whole picture of today's family alienation. As far as I am concerned, there are several reasons for the above phenomena.The first reason is that people spend more time on their studies and work. Nowadays, people face fierce competition and suffer from great pressure. As a result, they have to devote more time and energy to their careers. Some people are too busy to spare time for their family. What is more, many jobs require people to work in other cities and many children have to leave their parents at an early age to study or work elsewhere. As time passes, these people become emotionally estranged from their families.The alienation among families is also attributed to the increasing number of entertainments available. High technology brings modern people more interesting things which can easily attract their attention, such as watching TV, surfing the Internet or playing video games. Consequently, people are addicted to these activities, totally neglecting the feelings of their family members.Last but not least, people are now more independent than before. Apart from their family, they can easily get help from their friends and it is much easier to make more friends as a result of the rapid improvement in telecommunication. Therefore they are not as dependent on their families as before. To bring families closer, people put forward various suggestions. First, we should spare more time with our family members, no matter how occupied we are. Second, teach children the sense of family when they are still young. Last but not least, the government should organize activities to promote public awareness of the importance of a harmonious family relationship.",8
Some people think it would be a good idea for schools to teach every young person how to be a good parent. Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"Generation gap, which is inevitable between youngsters and elders, is not strange to modern people. As for the solution to that problem, various methods have been adopted including introducing relevant courses in schools to educate students how to be a good parent. I am in total favour of that idea.If students can be provided with sufficient knowledge of what constitutes a qualified parent, they can better understand their parents. As we know, some generation conflicts derive not from intrinsic contradiction, but lack of mutual understanding, so if it is possible that children can have access to how to be good parents, they will recognize how much enormous sacrifice their parents have made to bring children up. Accordingly, a harmonious relationship between parents and children can be definitely established.Additionally, through schooling about qualifications of parents, children are more prepared for their future adult life. It is generally agreed that the ultimate purpose of most education is to furnish students with essential skills to cope with problems confronted when stepping into society. One day, youngsters will not be naive, and they form their own families and become parents themselves. Thus some early information about desirable attributes of parents is that invaluable and indispensable to blessed families. After all, the early bird catches the worm.However, there should be some limitations on that practice. As children, nowadays, have been already overburdened with study, education of being good parents need not take up too much time. Secondly, taking children's premature cognitive power into account, teacher shad better select such materials as can be easily understood for those still young children. Only in this way, can the desirable effect be achieved.Overall, I welcome the reform that when children are at their early age, they know how to be a good parent. Perhaps, the term generation gap"" will be soon rendered out-of-date since parents and children begin to behave more like friends than strangers without too much in common.""",7
Parents are the best teachers. Do you agree or disagree?,"Obviously, the earliest teachers we have in our lives in most cases are our parents, and they are generally the most involved in the development and education of their children. Yet neither are all parents good teachers nor are those good parents, in most cases, the best teachers.First of all, not all parents are good teachers. As normal individuals, some parents more or less have bad habits. Even though parents almost instinctively devote themselves to cultivating their offspring, the outcome might turn out to be disappointing, for all children tend to unconsciously or subconsciously copy everything from their parents. Another deficiency of parents as teachers is the fact that most parents lack the common senses of education. All too often we observe that some parents tend to pursue their own cherished but failed dreams by forcing their children to develop in a prearranged direction.Moreover, some parents are qualified as good teachers, but not all of them are the best ones. When children are in the preliminary school, it is not surprising that parents are capable of teaching their children almost every subject. But the situation will not last long. We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized. Therefore, to be a professional in a certain field today takes a much long time than ever before. No parent is able to be professional in all fields, though they might be experts in one or more fields.Most parts of children's education is virtually beyond teachers' reaches. In a word, it is rather superficial to simply say that parents are the best teachers.",8
A person's childhood years (the time from the birth to the age of twelve years) are the most important years of a person's life. Do you agree or disagree?,"It is generally accepted that a person's childhood years are very important years of their life.But it is hardly appropriate to say those years are the most important.We do not reject the importance of childhood years. Actually it is rather important for the later part of a person's life. Our lives are subject to surroundings. Our world views have been structured from our childhood. Therefore, every one actually sees his own world differently to others. Even though we all live in a single world, every one of us in fact lives in a distinctive world, which are determined by our distinctive perceptions from individual to individual.Hence, we should not suspect that a person's life is influenced by one's childhood.Childhood, however, is merely one of several factors that shape one's later life. Among various factors is one's learning ability. Human beings are superior to any other animals simply because of their ability to learn. Psychology teaches us that training and self-training can alter our characteristics which may eventually alter our lives. Furthermore, learning is a life long process, which means every part of one's life could be an essential period and could play an indispensable role in one's life. For example, Einstein was taken for an idiot by his teacher when he was a child. The awkward attitude of his stupid teacher made Einstein's childhood an awful one. Nevertheless, Einstein did lead a wonderful life.Most parents nowadays seem to believe that childhood is the most important phase of one's life, and therefore often force their children to learn those alleged essential skills. The fact is, such behaviour is rather presumptuous, because, there are still many other important factors that affect one's life.",8
"Nowadays, nurseries and kindergartens take care of children from an early age, so women can return to their work and children can get used to the society early. Is this a good thing? What's your opinion?","Child care is a big issue in all families, and there is a heated debate on the best method of handling it. Nowadays there is a growing tendency for parents to send their children earlier to nurseries and kindergartens. Some even go to nurseries and kindergartens at age 2 or 3so that mothers can be freed from child care and pursue their own careers. People from different backgrounds, however, hold different attitudes toward the matter in question.Some people claim that children should be sent to nurseries earlier. First of all, psychologically speaking, the child needs more opportunities to communicate with his peers. The main task of the child care establishments is to inculcate honesty, courage, discipline, cooperation, friendliness, and good manners. Second, it is beneficial for them to receive systematic and scientific care and rudimentary knowledge from well-trained professionals. Last but not least, sending children earlier to nursery schools enable smothers to devote more time and energy to their jobs. In this way, career success becomes more possible, which is very beneficial to the whole family.However, people rarely reach an absolute consensus on such a controversial issue. The opponents argue that sending children earlier to nursery schools has its demerits. In the first place, it may lead to poorer parent-child relationship for lack of emotional communication. In addition, with mother staying at home, children will be better cared for and given more attention. On the other hand, in nurseries and kindergartens, there is the possibility of lacking adequate care and attention because there are so many children in a class. Moreover, although the family may lose some income, its expenditure will also be greatly reduced. It will no longer be necessary to pay for attending nurseries and kindergartens.Undeniably, there are points in both sides of the argument. But after a careful consideration of the above reasons, I stand on the side of the opponents. To start nursery schools too early is harmful for children mentally. Children who are sent earlier to nursery schools lack the affection of parents. Furthermore, mothers are the first teacher of their own child and exert profound impact on the child's future growth.",8
"Corporal punishment has been practiced in families for quite a long time. In recent years, people's attitudes towards this practice have undergone drastic changes. Nowadays many people strongly oppose it. Should corporal punishment be abolished?","Psychologists warn the parents to respect children's freedom and rights. A good old-fashioned corporal punishment is out of the question. On the other hand, cases of corporal punishment are reported to take place in families now and then. Indeed, the issue whether or not corporal punishment should be abolished has aroused a heated discussion among people.Those who strongly advocate that corporal punishment should not be abolished have cogent reasons for it. First of all, as a proverb says, spare the rod, spoil the child"". Children should be taught to respect discipline, which is the basis of all achievements. Little children are like young trees. In order to grow well, they need to be carefully irrigated, fertilized and trimmed. Furthermore, it helps to reinforce the authority of teachers and parents. Children are hardy creatures. Sometimes they will test the patience of their parents and teacher; teachers and parents should not be too permissive; otherwise they will spoil the children.But the people who hold the view that corporal punishment should be abolished also have sound reasons. In the first place, it seriously violates the legal rights and interests of children.Children are human beings too. They enjoy the same equal human rights as adults do. Their parents have no right to exercise corporal punishment on them. In addition, children may be hurt psychologically. Researches reveal that students who suffer from corporal punishment tend to resort to violence in their future life. Last but not least, it endangers children's physical development. It is a kind of brutality and cruelty which may lead to injury or even death of the children. Recently it is reported in the newspaper that one child lost his hearing due to his father's cruelty.When we consider these two sides more carefully, we can see that corporal punishment does more harm than good to children. Their rights are violated by the uncivilized action. It is detrimental to children's physical and mental development. Therefore, corporal punishment should by all means be forbidden in families.""",8
"Different people hold different views as to whether parents should adopt an instruction or punishment as the principal method for raising their children. If punishment is chosen as the main method, in what ways would you recommend that parents carry it out?","Some people believe that parents should resort to instruction and edification as the main ways to raise their children, while many others maintain that the predominant measure parents ought to take is to discipline them, to make sure that they don't fall into the same pits in the future. Personally I agree with the latter opinion. Moreover, I believe that the best results can be obtained in the following ways.In the first place, parents should try to create a family milieu in which the character development of their children is not suppressed and the young feel free to air their own points of view on various matters. The result will be that the young people will grow up to be men and women of honesty, sincerity, professional commitment and expertise.In the second place, parents should show due respect for their children's personal interests and inclinations as regards their future careers. Some parents try to blueprint the entire future development paths of their children when they are convinced that their authority allows no challenge and their discipline will do the young no harm. However, parents should be on guard against any overuse of preaching and discipline lest it provokes nothing but resentment and rebellion.All in all, disciplining the young can indeed impress upon their minds the conduct they are expected to adopt in society. Yet, the aim of punishment should not be to make the children regard their parents as dictators and fear them. Parents should do all they can to leave plenty of latitude for the development of their children's characters, and not overuse the lever of discipline.",8
"If a five old child commits a crime, should his/her parents have the responsibility and be pun-ished? What is the age of a child when parents no longer bear the responsibility for children's behave-iour? What is your opinion?","It is not uncommon that numerous youngsters are involved in heinous crimes and some kids are only five or six years old, which is really alarming to adults. Who should take the responsibility for this social deterioration, parents or other relevant people? Undoubtedly, as legal guardian and early mentor, parents cannot evade the responsibility and are the main culprits.Of course, we have to admit the fact that social immoral atmosphere, such as the flooding of on-line games, contributes to increasing juvenile delinquency, for violence and pornography contained in the content exert a negative impact on children's vulnerable minds. According to the latest survey, the majority of youth crimes take place in the net bar, where there are actually no effective measures to supervise the operation. Parents, however, are more to blame compared with social factors.In comparison, parents are far more influential to their children's development. Due to lack of economic independence, kids have to spend the majority of their time living with their parents, so inevitably, what parents have done and said will affect underage children to a large extent. If parents commit a crime, then their children will take it for granted and follow suit.In modern society, that divorce tate rockets aggravates the youth crimes. As youngters undergoing growth both physically and psychologically, a healthy family Provides invaluable love and guidance for vulnerable children, who often fall victim to abuse and injury. If that is true, it is not difficult to perceive desperate feeling suffocating poor kids when parents choose to depart from each other and at that time perhaps their children resort to crimes to revenge themselves on their parents.Numerous tragedies have revealed the truth that parents are the immediate contribution to the increase in youth crimes. Perhaps when kids grow to 18 or above, there is no need for parents to be criticized, for by comparison society is a more direct reason.",8
Some people think that parents should spend more time with their children. Do you agree or disagree?,"In China, the parents both have their jobs. With the development of economy, people tend to pursue high quality living conditions. Most of the parents try their best to offer their children comfortable circumstances, but they seldom have time to stay with their children. In my point of view, no matter how busy they are, they should make the best use of their time to stay with their children.First, the relationship between children and adults will be enhanced with parents' spending more time on their children. Children could feel parents' affection through the genial conversation and sharing their pleasure with them. Every time when parents take them to the amusement park, help them to prepare their birthday parties, applaud for them when they are competing in the sports meeting, the time they spend with children will become treasure in their memories.Second, children need the direction from their parents. There are some wrong behaviours in our society such as dishonesty, corruption, violence and eroticism and so on. Children have weak resistance in defending this detrimental influence. In this case, parents' instructions seem to be very important to children's growth. Parents should sit down and talk with them about what they should and shouldn't do. In addition, if parents often spend time in staying with their children, adults' good behaviours will greatly influence their children.Here I do not deny that there are some disadvantages in spending too much time on children. Some parents restrict their children, and give them little freedom to develop their interests. Therefore, I emphasize that parents should educate and instruct their children appropriately in their spare time apart from their busy works.",8
Should parents be obliged to immunize their children against common childhood disease? Or do individuals have the right to choose not to immunize their children?,"The issue of whether we should force parents to immunize their children against common diseases is, in my opinion, a social rather than a medical question. Since we are free to choose what we expose our bodies to in the way of food, drink, or religion for that matter, why should the question of medical treatment"" be any different?Medical researchers and governments are primarily interested in overall statistics and trends and in money-saving schemes which fail to take the individual's concerns and rights into consideration.While immunization against diseases such as tetanus and whooping cough may be effective, little information is released about the harmful effects of vaccinations which can sometimes result in stunted growth or even death.The body is designed to resist disease and to create its own natural immunity through contact with that disease.So when children are given artificial immunity, we create a vulnerable society which is entirely dependent on immunization. In the event that mass immunization programs were to cease, the society as a whole would be more at risk than ever before.In addition there is the issue of the rights of the individual. As members of a society, whys hould we be obliged to subject our children to this potentially harmful practice? Some people may also be against immunization on religious grounds and their needs must also be considered.For these reasons I feel strongly that immunization programs should not be obligatory and that the individual should have the right to choose whether or not to participate.""",8
Nowadays the jet plane is considered to be one of the most important and influential inventions in the world. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"Since jet plane appeared in the 1950s, it has had some revolutionary effects. Many people are of the opinion that it is one of the most important and influential inventions in the world. Some others, however, disagree with them. It seems quite clear to me that one of the most important and influential inventions in the world has been the development of jet plane. My arguments for this point are listed as follows.One of the reasons is that jet travel brings us great convenience and efficiency. A hundred years ago, it took weeks to cross the Atlantic or Pacific oceans by ship. Today, those same trips can be completed in a matter of hours. One can attend a meeting in Paris and have dinner in New York at the same day. These amazing speeds have changed people's concepts of space. Today the world is much smaller than it was in the past.Another reason why I advocate the attitude is that jet travel is relatively cheap. An international journey one hundred years ago was extremely expensive. Only wealthy people could afford to travel comfortably in first class. Poor people had to save for years to purchase a ticket, and the conditions in which they traveled were not very good. Today it is possible for more and more people in every country to travel in comfort. Thus it is possible for business people to do business all over the world, for students to attend universities in other countries, and for tourists to take vacations anywhere in the world.For the reasons presented above, I strongly commit to the notion that jet plane is one of the most important and influential inventions in the world. The speed and low cost of jet travel have changed the world. Individual nations are not as isolated as they were in the past, and people now think of the whole planet as they once thought of their own hometowns.",7
What are the advantages and disadvantages of the Internet?,"In recent years, the Internet has been gaining its popularity at an amazing rate. It seems that anyone who knows little about the Internet is out of date and lags far behind the times.he Internet plays such an important role that it undeniably becomes the biggest concern of the world.Those who favour that the Internet has many advantages give their reasons as follows. In the first place, the Internet brings us great convenience and efficiency. For example, we can send e-mails to our friends in other countries in a few minutes while sending a traditional letter takes us at least a week and costs much. In the second place, we can make friends with people from all parts of the world. It overcomes the geographical barriers and makes the world smaller. Furthermore, the Internet accelerates the flow of information and spreads education to all corners of the globe. We can have easy and quick access to the latest information worldwide.However, the other side of the coin voices its strong opposition, saying that the Internet has many weaknesses. For one thing, it can easily lead to psychological problems. An Internet-addicted person tends to be isolated, self-centered and unsociable. For another, there is a sharp rise in the number of cyber crimes. More and more financial crimes such as money laundering are committed via the Internet. In addition, it also has negative impacts on young people because there are a lot of obscene and violent contents on line.Researches reveal that people who watch too much violence tend to resort to brutal behaviour when arguments happen.For my part, I completely agree with the latter view that the Internet has more disadvantages than advantages. It gives rise to people's mental problems. It results in various computer crimes. What is more, it is harmful to the growth of the young. Some measures should be taken as soon as possible to protect people from the negative effects of the Internet.",8
The development o drawbacks?,"The development of science and technology makes our life more comfortable and convenient.

Modern telecommunication shortens the distance between people and makes communication much easier. Internet is widely used now not only for collection of abundant information but also for correspondence. E-mail, the most effective communication device now, is becoming very popu-lar. Besides, telephone and mobile phone make contact more convenient than before.Modern transportation, such as airplanes and high-speed trains make our journey smooth and fast. With the help of modern transportation, people can go everywhere they prefer to.The journey to outer space and other planets is not a dream any more. Rockets and space shuttles can help us realize the dream of space travel.Modern medicine prolongs people's life and relieves patients of sufferings from many diseases. Cancer and AIDS are fatal to people's health. Thanks to the endeavors scientists have made, these diseases become treatable.However, the process of scientific development also arouses many severe problems to our human beings. Internet, though widely used in modern communication, is easy to be destroyed by computer viruses. Outer space exploration has produced much waste in the space. A tiny metal, a screw, for example can destroy a flying man-made satellite. Industrialization is making natural resources become scarce.Confronted with these problems, scientists are seeking prompt and feasible solutions. The development of science and technology bring about both positive and negative effects to us. We must eliminate the negative effects to the least extent.",8
Do you agree or disagree that technological development is always good?,"Technology threatens and inflicts damage upon our quality of life. The technological developments of this century are creating widespread plagues that could soon destroy the entire world.Let us take air for example. Due to massive air pollution, what we breathe is not relatively safe like it used to be. The fumes from the exhausted pipes of automobiles, trucks and factories blow waste material into the atmosphere. After a period of time, atmospheric changes occur. The fumes, that are collected in the atmosphere, are slowly eating away at the ozone layer. This layer of the atmosphere is what shields us from solar ultra-violet rays. Once this layer is gone, our natural protection against the sun would be gone, and if we were hit by one ray of the sun, we'd burst into flames and turn into a cinder.Another plague of technology is nuclear power. The power that can energize entire cities with electricity could also be the power to destroy. After 1945, the research on nuclear power has increased significantly. Contrary to the belief that it is safe, nuclear power has a way of destroying the whole city. It is not like a fire that can be put out with water or CO2, but spe-cial equipments[d11] have to be used. Afterwards that place would remain radioactive for quite along time, devoid of life and sound.So you see, if technology cannot be halted, our fate is unknown. Our end will not come about by natural means, but by our own technological achievements, and life on Earth would cease to exist.",8
"There have been many technological developments in the 20th century. Choose one of them, describethe changes it has brought about and discuss whether all the changes are positive.","The last century featured many technological revolutions the world over. Among them, computer technology has been the most remarkable. Its rapid development and proliferation of use have changed everything from the way the work is done to cutting-edge scientific research.First of all, computers free us from heavy workload. With the advent of word processors, mistakes in articles can be corrected and editing done without the need to rewrite or retype the entire paper. It is also possible to generate large, stylized type for headings and ill ustrationsso that books can be prepared ready for print.The computer has also brought about great changes in the financial and scientific world. A good case in point is the use of computers in banking. With its help, financial institutions are able to keep track of balances and transactions automatically and more efficiently than they did in the past. In the scientific community, one of its advantages is itsnumber-crunching"" power. This has made accurate weather forecasting possible. It spower has also enabled scientists to get a clearer picture of the human genome.However, not all the changes have had a positive impact on human beings and as a whole. There are quite serious health consequences of a sedentary life in front of a computer, the most obvious being eye strain. Furthermore, it is the social consequences that are more alarming. The computer and the Internet have made direct human contact less and less necessary, which had led to human relationships becoming less close and more confusing.Although some undesirable consequences have arisen from using computer, on the whole, I feel we should embrace the technological advance. There is every reason to believe that computers represent even more efficiency and effectiveness in the future.""",8
"With the help of technology, students nowadays can learn more information and learn it more quickly. Do you agree or disagree?","It is undeniable that developing technologies have brought tremendous benefits, especially in learning area. Learning has become easier than before. For example, today, new devices, such as MP3 or MD players, are offered in market and relevant learning materials are easily and free to download on the Internet. However, it is a little bit hasty to assert that students can learn more information and more quickly, simply because technology helps.Technologies always contribute both benefits and detriments. For example, computers help students a lot in various ways, but at the same time have many negative even harmful impacts on the students. Most students nowadays play computer games.Sitting before the table, staring at the screen, clicking mouse button; the outcomes are cerebrum fatigue, visual deprivation and time waste. Chatting on the Internet is another great way to kill precious time, and one of negative side-effects of key. Board dependence makes students spelling incorrectly. Worst of all, investigations have shown that more than half of time that students have spent online was exhausted on browsing porn movies, fictions or erotic photos etc.Students certainly want to learn more information and to learn more quickly. But technology is not the solution. Learning is a skill and it only develops by practice. Computers and other devices can certainly help, but they won't make study any less painful. Technologies provide no solution to overcome indolence that everyone has. Learning has never been easy, and will not become easier merely because of technologies. It always requires tremendous effort and determination. Too much advocate of the fancy benefits of technologies will merely mislead, much more than virtually help.",8
"Computers do not help children to learn more effectively. In addition, their usage has negative effects on both the physical and mental development of young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Some people think that computers do not help children learn more effectively. The use of computers in schools has negative effects on children's physical and mental development. Personally, I am not in favour of the point. I think children can benefit a lot from using computers.Now there appear good educational softwares[d12] that enable children to develop and practise some fundamental skills. They can help them learn, for example, about letters, numbers, shapes, and rhythm. Good softwares can also help children develop their procedural thinking and creative expression. Besides, computers help children to be in control of their experience, to set their own pace, and to select the level of challenge with which they feel Comfortable. They learn more effectively with the aid of computers than only by means of traditional techniques.It is also good for children's mental development to use computers in schools. By using computers children develop self-confidence and self-esteem as they master computer skills. And they will build positive attitudes toward technology. In addition, in the class roomsetting children often prefer working with one or two partners over working alone, which leads to the development of social skills.It is true that frequent and prolonged computer sessions may pose physical health risks for children, such as harmful effects of radiation, and posture and skeletal problems. In the case of normal usage and normal operating conditions, however, research has shown that computer monitors are safe and do not harm our eyes and that computer monitors emit little or no harmful radiation.To sum up, computers are good tools for children in study and beneficial to children's mental and physical health.",8
"Some people say that computers can translate all kinds of languages. Therefore, it is not necessary for children to learn foreign languages. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","The fantastic development of computers has made it possible for people to live better than ever possible before. It seems that people can never do without them. One good illustration is that with computers updating, all kinds of languages can now be translated by computers. Some people even hold the opinion that with this, children do not need to learn foreign languages. The argument seems reasonable, but speaking for myself, I to tallydisagree with it.The quality of computer translation cannot be ensured. It is clear that computers can only translate literally or word by word. Sometimes, we find ourselves confused by the head-scratching puzzlement about what they really want to tell. What makes matters worse is that machine translation is used in literature and science translation. The prime of some masterpieces can never be appreciated and some facts may be distorted.Additionally, a foreign language is always closely related to a country's cultures and customs. To study a foreign language well, one is supposed to not only focus on language learning itself, but also attach importance to a country's cultures and customs from which the language stems. This practice can only be experienced by a learner himself. Computer translation, in this case, settles nothing and cannot replace people's own efforts.The charm of a language also lies in the fact that it is a precious gift of human beings. When studying a foreign language, students can develop their intelligence, stimulate their imagination and creativity, form a good habit of industry and strengthen their confidence. The process of learning a foreign language is actually the way to cultivate students' all-around development. Computer translation, no matter how wonderful it is, can never play such a role in this process.Eye-catching as computer translation may seem, it is by no means a cure-all solution. Maybe, with it, students can study a foreign language better. However, it cannot replace the role of students in learning a foreign language. After all, it is human beings who are the master of languages.",8
The computer is widely used in education and some people think teachers do not play an important role in the classroom. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"As the pace of digital technology speeds up, computers are now widely applied in education and winning tremendous popularity. However, there is no yet absolute agreement on the question whether teachers are of no use with this trend. As I see it, although computers employed in education enjoy an array of benefits such as high speed, easy accessibility and great efficiency, teachers are still of significance.On a substantive level, computers have reshaped the teaching as well as studying way. For teachers[d13], computers make the teaching method more colourful[d14], vivid and interesting. For students, computers help them finish their homework efficiently, obtain up-to-date information, expand their horizon and stimulate their interests in science.In spite of this, that teachers' roles will be replaced is a plausible hypothesis rather than reality. It is always the case that teachers can play an indispensable and imperative part that computers cannot. Teachers not only teach us knowledge, but render us many other things such as the positive attitude to life, moral instructions, the courage to overcome difficulties, a host of practical skills, to name just a few. As for students, they are often more crucial than knowledge itself. It is hard to imagine that without teachers, computers can perform as well as teachers do.Another point to note is that students are immature and are easily affected by adverse influence by computers. Nowadays, it is not rare to see that many students are addicted to computer games and live in a virtual world per day. As a result, they cannot concentrate on their study. What is even worse is that many youngsters are indulged in the Internet where violence, pornography and bloody contents are pervasive. Due to their inexperience and gullibility, they may go astray after watching too many these programs. From this angle, the existence of teachers is a must for the simple reason that they can supervise and educate students.Above all, I am still inclined to support the opinion that computers can never replace teachers. After all, the computer is only a vital assistant in teaching and it is teachers who make a difference in education.",8
Some people claim that public museums and art galleries will not be needed because people can see historical objects and works of art by using a computer. Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"It is simply absurd to assert that with historical objects and works of art being able to be seen through a computer, public museums and art galleries will no longer be needed.First of all, computers can never replace real public museums and art galleries. No matter how real and vivid computer images are, they are only images, not the historical objects and works of art that we see in real or even might be allowed to touch with our fingertips. For those who claim museums and galleries are no longer needed because they can see all they want to on a computer screen. I'd like to suggest that they marry a wife or husband in the computer rather than in real life!In the second place, visiting real museums and art galleries is a rewarding experience in many respects. For one thing, it is a good exercise. While we are making the trip to a museum or art gallery and then strolling about on site, we take some exercise which does a lot of good to our health. For another thing, we can feast our eyes on all kinds of things there and experience the wonder, beauty and exquisite workmanship with our own eyes in an active way instead of in a passive manner by looking at what are being displayed to us by others on the screen. For yet another thing, we protect our eyesight by moving away from the computer screen and see the real objects on site.It is true that computers have brought great conveniences to our life. At certain times, especially when it is temporarily impossible for us to visit museums and art galleries in person, we can get a rough picture of what are on display on site. However, what we see from a computer screen is, after all, not exactly the same as what we see and feel with our own eyes[d15] on site.In conclusion, computers will never be able to replace real public museums and art galleries. Therefore, it is ridiculous to say that one does not need to go to museums and art galleries as historical objects and works of art can be appreciated on a computer screen.",8
Are computers an essential feature of modern education? Are there aspects of a good education that cannot be taught using computers?,"Computers are now essential in many areas of life—modern banking, retail and information exchange[d16] among others. However, this is not true for education. At a simple level, some subjects may be better taught using computers, but to explain important concepts a human teacher is still indispensable.There are some subjects in which a computer can be used successfully to teach. Elementary mathematics, elementary language learning, any area which requires a student to memorise[d17] basic facts through repetition is well suited to computer learning. The computer can be programmed to provide an endless number of simple questions, and as the students answer these questions, the facts are learned and reinforced.However, in the learning and practice of more complex ideas, the computer is not adequate. A computer can evaluate an answer as right or wrong, but it cannot determine why. It cannot find out why a student is making mistakes, and then re-present important concepts in a different way so the student will understand. It cannot determine at what stage in a mathematics problem the student has made an error, it can only indicate that the final answer is wrong. Tasks involving reasoning cannot be taught by computers, as there are too many variables for a computer to deal with successfully.Thus, while computers may be useful as a tool for practising[d18] simple skills, they are not an essential feature of modern education, because they cannot monitor a student's grasp of concepts, nor evaluate a student's reasoning. Until further developments in computers are made, the human teacher will remain indispensable.",8
"The computer is widely used in education, and some people think teachers do not play important roles in the classroom and they will be replaced by computers. To what extent do you agree?","The computer is playing an increasingly important role in our daily life and it is also widely used in education. Some people even propose a suggestion that we will never need teachers from now on. There have been two quite different views on this issue.The use of computers in education seems to have important benefits for both students and teachers. First, the computer has the ability to accommodate to individual differences in learning speed, and so students can control the pace of lessons. Another advantage is that a computer can give immediate feedback. Most important of all, the computer offers numerous merits to teachers in preparing instructional materials, managing their classes and keeping students' records, thereby cutting down on time-consuming paperwork.Compared with the computer, however, teachers are indispensable to students. First, the computer's capacity is limited, so attending lectures is very essential for students whose ability of independent study is not fully established. Second, it is the professionally trained teachers' duty to give students moral education. Apart from the knowledge and skills, children in school also learn how to behave themselves, how to abide by the rules and regulations of the society and how to adjust themselves to the society. But the computer can do little in this aspect. The self-control ability of children is not enough. Without teachers' supervision, they tend to ignore their study.In my opinion, even if the computer can be of great help to teachers as well as to students, it will never replace teachers' work. We should never be so dependent on computers. If so, wehumans would sooner or later become slaves of machines.",8
What disadvantages will people meet if they cannot use computers? What should our government do?,"The computer plays a very important role in people's work and life. We can't imagine what our world would be like without computers. With the popularization of computer knowledge, more and more people can use computers. But there are still others who are not familiar with it. From my point of view, I think they will confront a lot of trouble and difficulties.Firstly, most machines and equipment are controlled by computer nowadays, such as, automobile industry, manufacturing, power station and even airplanes, which can improve the efficiency of our work. If a person can not use computers, he will have difficulty in operating machines. It is hard to imagine that a pilot can fly an airplane without intimate knowledge of computer. Without knowing computer knowledge, people will not fit in with the rhythm of our society.Secondly, people can acquire rich information on computer through Internet, which is abundant in valuable information. We can get a lot of information about world events, arts, movies and the latest development of science and technology. If a person can not use computers, he / she will be out of fashion and lag far behind the others.Finally, the computer plays a very important role in education. For instance, students have to revise their thesis when they are fulfilling their thesis. Without a computer, the revision work will be very tedious. In addition, students can study some long-distance courses on computer through Internet, which can enlarge their knowledge.Taking into account of the disadvantages people will meet, I think the government should do something to popularize computer knowledge. Firstly, the government and the authorities concerned should popularize computer knowledge in primary schools and secondary schools. Secondly, the society and the communities should organize some training courses to the people who cannot use computer.To sum up, in the rapidly developing society, if people cannot use computer, they will meet many difficulties in their work and life.",8
Telecommuting refers to workers doing their jobs from home for part of each week and communicating with their office using computer technology. Telecommuting is growing in many countries and is expected to be common for most office workers in the coming decades. How do you think society will be affected by the growth of telecommuting?,"The spread of telecommuting is sure to have far-reaching effects on society. But itself, telecommuting refers to office workers spending much of their employers. The broader implications of telecommuting, however, may involve changes to corporate structure, workers' lifestyles and even urban planning.The most obvious changes may be apparent in the normal"" offices of companies, governments and other organizations. If even half the working week is spent telecommuting from home, then we would initially expect many empty desks in the office. As offices grow smaller, workers coming in for the day would be expected to share desks with their absent colleagues. This, in turn, may affect the social atmosphere of an organization. However, less social contact with one's colleagues could harm morale and loyalty.For the individual office worker, telecommuting would mean spending more time at home. For a parent with young children, this may be a blessing. Moreover, many telecommuters would be able to work the hours they wished: having a nap in the afternoon, for example, but working some hours in the evening. One substantial benefit for all telecommuting workers is that there will be no need to travel to work, allowing more free time.The structure of urban life is also likely to be affected by telecommuting. We would expect to see fewer cars on the road during peak hours and, eventually, a smaller concentration of offices in cities' central business districts. In short, people will have fewer reasons to travel to city centres[d20] from outlying areas. As more people work and live in the same location, shops and cultural events will likely relocate themselves out of the city Centre.In sum, telecommuting will serve not only to change the way we work but also the way we live.""",8
Some people think that the use of computers should be restricted. Do you agree or disagree?,"In this IT age, computer literacy has become a skill required of workers in practically every field. In some countries, computers have even been introduced into the classrooms of primary schools.However, some people advocate limiting the use of computers in such classes, arguing that they might retard children's ability to read, write and calculate. In my opinion, such restriction is totally unnecessary.Two or three decades ago, when pocket calculators were popular, some people were concerned that their use by primary school children might hamper their ability to calculate. But this was not the case, and it was the children who learned to use pocket calculators at that time who grew up to design personal computers (PC). As a result, the PC-based Internet has increasingly become an integrated part of the world, and people can no longer afford to be computer-illiterate.Therefore, it is clear that the more skillful you are at computer use, the more competent and efficient you will be. It is imperative to arm young people with computer knowledge as early as possible. To limit the use of computers by pupils in primary schools is to limit their access to a powerful tool. This will put these children in an unfavorable position in the future job market when they compete with others who had been given free access to computers earlier.It is foolish to insist on using shields and spears when you have guns and tanks, due to the mere concern that soldiers will be physically less strong. You can still use your mind to think when you have a computer, and the use of computers and training in writing and calculating are not mutually exclusive.We have always worried about the potential harmful impact on people, especially children, posed by the introduction of new technologies. But time after time, such worries have proved to be unfounded.",8
"Now, air travel has become much cheaper than in the past. Some people say that is a positive development, while some people disagree with this. What do you think? Give your reason.","Nowadays, people can choose to travel by bus, train, ship, and airplane. In the past, travelling by air was too expensive to be popular, but things are different now: air travel has become much cheaper. Therefore, I argue that this is definitely a positive development.Firstly, airplane travels extremely fast, thus it saves us a lot of time. We know that in the past, travelling from Britain to America by ship would take at least a month, but now it on lyneeds five to eight hours.One can start out from Britain in the morning and join friends in the States for dinner! In fact, thanks to the fast speed of airplane, many lives have been saved.Secondly, traveling by air is safer than by any other means of transport. There are car crashes happening here and there on highways, taking away thousands of lives every day. People may think that train and ship are much safer than airplane, but statistics show that the rate of an airplane crash is far lower than these two means of transport. I have travelled by air dozens of times and am quite confident about the safety of air traveling.Sure enough, apart from some worries about the safety of airplane, people are also worried that due to the cheaper prices of air tickets, there will be more and more people choosing to travel by air, thus resulting in huge consumption of fuel and severe air pollution. This is indeed a problem worth our deep consideration. However, I firmly believe that with the development of science and technology, new types of fuel will definitely be found and then, air travel will pose no threat at all to the environment.From the foregoing discussion, we can see that air travel becoming cheaper and cheaper is absolutely not a bad thing.",8
"Air transport is increasingly used to export types of fruits and vegetables to countries where they cannot be grown or are out of season. Some people say it is a good thing, but other people think it can't be justified. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Nowadays, we have more choices of fruits and vegetables in our lives. For example, people living in the south of China are able to eat fruits and vegetables from the north or even from abroad. This should be attributed to the convenience brought about by air transport.First of all, airplanes have made possible the transport of fruits and vegetables over long distances. In the past when there were no airplanes, this was completely impossible as fresh fruit and vegetable get bad and rotted easily. With the appearance of air transport, what would have taken several days, a few weeks or even months in the past now only takes a couple of hours to be done. Therefore, fruits and vegetables from faraway places are able to get onto our tables as fresh as newly picked.Second, air shipping fruits and vegetables has enhanced the economic development and the quality of life of the people of both the exporting and importing places. If the fruits and vegetables of a certain place can be transported within a short period of time to other places or countries, the local people and the government would benefit in the first place. This is easy to understand in that both the local people and the government would have cash in hand. In the second place, the people and governments of the places where fruits and vegetables are transported to are also benefited. The markets would have more varieties to offer and the governments would have more tax to collect.Sure, air transporting fruits and vegetables consumes large amounts of fuel and human labour and these make the prime reasons for many people to say no to it. Besides, due to the high cost of shipment, these fruits and vegetables are usually very expensive when they finally appear on the markets. However, it is consumers who decide whether they will buy them or not, therefore, it is always a good thing that they at least have more choices.From the foregoing discussion, we see that air transporting fruit and vegetables is fully justified.",8
Billions of money has been spent on the space research. Some people say that it should be spent in improving the living standard of the people on the earth. Do you agree or disagree?,"It has been almost forty years since Armstrong proudly uttered, That's one small step fora man, one giant leap for mankind."" Indeed, it is worthwhile to celebrate such a feat for human beings since space research of the moon-landing was totally unbelievable in the past. Some people, however, maintain that life is the same without any dramatic change. Istrongly doubt the validity of this statement.Without the exploration of unknown places, human beings can never solve the alarming energy crisis. Economic development around the world has accelerated the demand for energy substantially, which leads to resources crisis on the earth. If there is no petrol, coal or natural gas for humans, then the day of destruction will not be a fairy tale. Space research provides mankind with chances of locating new resources, something like water and minerals indispensable to humans.Moreover, successful research in outer space encourages people to be more adventurous, and that valuable spirit is essential to historical advance. From barbarian states to modern civilizations, no progress can be achieved without exploring unknown places and the invention of airplanes is the best example. If humans, who have long yearned to fly in the sky like birds, fail to engage themselves in daunting experiments, it is not hard to imagine that long-distance travel can only be realized in people's wildest dreams.Indeed, space research means tremendous investment from national purse, causing due alarm from people. It is not a secret that billions of money has to be spent making sure a successful launch of satellites or spacecrafts. The possibility of new resources and the boost of people's morale, however, justify such a considerable input.Obviously, only through space research, can people live a truly decent life. Meanwhile, it is a must that this research should not serve a military purpose, and benefiting humans is the prerequisite.""",8
Should countries undertake space research?,"In the past, there were just two nations which undertook serious space exploration, namely the United States and the former Soviet Union.In fact, the space race"" began in the late1950s, with the Soviet Union launching the first manned rocket. It became a matter of national pride, as each country attempted to outdo the other in enhancing its international standing. When Americans landed the first man on the moon, it clearly represented a monumental national achievement.Furthermore, space research has produced a variety of practical and beneficial discoveries and applications. For instance, Teflon, a non-stick surface used in cooking utensils, such as frying pans, was developed as a result of the space program. Moreover, we have a better understanding of climate patterns, together with a modern system of electronic communications, as a direct result of the hundreds of satellites which encircle our planet.On the other hand, space research has considerable disadvantages. Obviously, space research is often carried out for military purposes. It undoubtedly adds to the arms race, endangering world peace. Think, for example, of American ""Star Wars"" project. How on earth does this benefit mankind?Environmentally, there are significant reasons against launching rockets into space. The huge boosters used by vehicles escaping the earth's gravity produce considerable pollution, damaging the precious ozone layer. In addition, there are countless pieces of ""space junk"" floating around above our planet which one day could constitute a serious hazard.""",8
Space travel to the moon is cited as a big step for the mankind. Some people think it made little difference to our daily lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"With the incredibly rapid advancement of science and technology, space exploration, which is considered to be a big step for human beings, has been carried out by many countries around the world. I disapprove of the claim that space travel to the moon made little difference to our daily lives, for it will benefit human race in many ways to a large scale.In the first place, the investment of time and money in space exploration could, in future, be paid back to humanity many times over; especially the discovery of resources in outer space could be of great benefit to our planet. It is universally acknowledged that, the shortage of natural resources, nowadays, becomes one of the most severe problems throughout the world. There is possibility of finding some resources available on the moon, which may help us to solve the intractable problem.Besides, the potential that other planets, taking the moon as an example, hold for colony could prove to be a salvation of the human race. Due to the population explosion on earth, humans begin to worry about the limited living space for their offspring. Therefore, it may be wise to exploit a completely new living space.On the other hand, some political analysts claim that the Space Race has led to unnecessary competition between nations and a consequent failure to cooperate and collaborate on international issues. Moreover, many sociologists argue that colonies in space would create more social problems than they would solve. Nonetheless, I am still in favor of space travel, for its merits far outweigh its demerits.In conclusion, in spite of some worries about space travel, it will, undisputedly, exert favorable effect on the human race, such as the discovery of new resources, the exploration of new colonies, and so on. Hence, it is of great necessity to conduct space travel to the moon.",8
Should we invest money in space research?,"For over fifty years, a number of nations have been involved in the exploration of outer space. This research has been very costly. Has this money been well-spent or wasted?Some people believe that the research should be eliminated because of its expense, not only in terms of money, but also in terms of the scientific and human resources. These people point out the fact that it cost billions of dollars to send astronauts to the moon, but they just brought back worthless rocks. These people say that the money and effort could be spent on more important projects right here on Earth, such as providing housing for homeless people, improving the education system, saving the environment, and finding cures for diseases.However, other people believe that space research has provided many benefits. They point out that hundreds of useful products, from personal computers to heart pacemakers to freeze-dried foods, are the direct or indirect results of space research. They say that weather and communication satellites are also products of space programs. In addition, supporters of the space program point to the scientific knowledge that has been acquired about the Sun, the Moon, the planets, and even our own Earth as a result of space research.I agree with those people who support space research. Space research,  has already brought many benefits to humanity. Perhaps it will bring even more unimaginable benefits in the future. Moreover, just as individual people need challenges to make their lives more interesting, I believe the human race itself needs a challenge, and I think that the peaceful exploration of outer space provides just such a challenge.",8
"More than three decades ago, man for the first time set foot on the moon. Some people think that space research is a waste of energy and money. Discuss and give your opinion.","It is an undeniable fact that it has been over thirty years since man's first landing on the moon, and his fascination with outer space has a much longer history than that. Some people believe that this type of study is a sheer waste of time and money. However, in my opinion, this issue has both pros and cons, and it should not be judged one-sidedly.On one hand, it indeed requires a great deal of time and money to train people to carry out research work in this sphere, to put the research into actual practice, and to sustain countless test failures. In addition, doubtlessly the time and money spent on space research and exploration is hard to calculate, as it is carried out by several nations. From this perspective, the research in question can be considered a waste of time, money and resource.One the other hand, however, once the research findings are transformed into productivity, we will see the situation in a different sight. For example, knowledge of other planets and stars may make possible the colonization of space. At that time, the expenditure that seems so wasteful now will serve to expand and extend the scope of human existence. Currently, the progress made by scientists who have dedicated much time and energy to thisresearch has demonstrated this point clearly and forcefully.In short, it truly takes a lot of time and money to carry out studies of outer space, for such research tests man's intelligence, patience and perseverance to the utmost, long before　any concrete results are visible. Nevertheless, people of vision will indubitably recognize the abundant benefits to be reaped once the research is completed and its findings are put into production.",8
Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the telephone.,"During the last century, the telephone was undoubtedly seen as one of the most important inventions. Its rapid development and proliferation of use throughout the world have been remarkable. Being part of modern life, it has affected society in a variety of ways, both positively and negatively.On the positive side, the telephone has been used as one of the most popular communication tools and favourably applied in many fields, such as doing business, communicating with people, providing more employment opportunities and dealing with emergencies. For example, the telephone has made doing business much easier and more efficient. Simply through a phone line, people can place or check on orders, saving the time when shopping for necessities.The telephone has also made the world seem smaller, since it allows us to stay in touch at any time with anybody, both near and far. In addition, with the advent of the telephone, telecommunication companies have been established, creating many job opportunities. In handling emergencies, the telephone seems to play a most important role. If your life is in danger, all you need to do is to dial 120, and doctors can be sent for immediately.On the negative side, the telephone can be a big time waster, both at work and at home. When at work, people are often distracted by one unwanted ring after another and, as a result, are kept away from finishing their daily tasks. At home, the telephone seems very inviting for some people who desire to communicate. Those in need of communication are often on the phone line just for casual talk for one hour or more. This, as a result, has made direct face-to-face human contact less and less necessary, which has led to human relationships becoming more confusing.The advantages this powerful invention has brought to us are obvious, while its disadvantages should not be ignored. Despite some of its negative influences on our society, its benefits will assure its future use.",8
The unlimited use of cars may cause many problems. What are those problems?,"The fast increase in the number of cars have brought along many related problems which are well worth our greatest attention.First of all, urban traffic is getting from bad to worse. I'd like to cite my own experience as an example. Five years ago, it took me about 30 minutes to drive from home to office. One year later, I needed to spend about 40 minutes on the way. Then two years later, I had to start out from home at least 1 hour earlier in order to get to my office on good time for work. And then, since last year, it has just been too normal for me to spend about one and half hours to make it. The traffic just moves like a worm!Second, with the ever growing number of cars, air quality in urban areas is deteriorating with each passing day. We used to see clear blue sky and breathe fresh air, but now this would be a real luxury. Car exhaust has seriously polluted the air and people's health is greatly endangered. It seems certain that we human beings have already made a fata lmistake that could only be remedied by bringing down the number of cars hugely.Sure, we can not deny the fact that cars have brought up speed, comfort and greater mobility. However, these have already been history. We are suffering much more from car sthan benefiting from them. Our health conditions are going down rapidly both due to the polluted air that we have to breathe every second and our lack of exercise as a result of the ever increasing amount of time we have to spend behind the wheel!What can we do? From the forgoing discussion, I'm sure we have already found a solution: to discourage people to use cars! I know very well that science and technology are developing very fast and there might be better solutions coming up in the future, but, before that, let's first salvage ourselves in such a passive way!",8
Please state the advantages and disadvantages of the development of private cars.,"With the fantastic spur both in industry and in economy in China, the number of people who own private cars is on the rise. Some people have bought cars of their own, and others are planning to buy cars. But there have been two quite different views on this phenomenon.Some claim that there are many advantages brought about by cars. First, the automobile industry provides jobs for countless workers and strong support for other industries.Second, if conditions permit, owning a car can make us work more efficiently. Finally, life will become more convenient. A car allows one to move freely and with a car there is no need to wait for the bus in the cold or under the burning sun.However, others strongly object to the increase in developing private cars. They hold that automobiles will give rise to a series of problems. In the first place, as more and more cars are produced and run in the street, a large volume of poisonous gas will be given off, polluting the atmosphere and causing actual harm to the health of people. Next, private cars contribute to traffic congestion so greatly that the advantages gained in comfort and freedom are often cancelled out by the frustration caused by traffic jams. The last problem is the increasing number of car accidents which have killed and will kill a lot of people in a friction of a second.In my opinion, although automobiles have been playing a vital part in the daily activities of our society, they also bring us numerous troubles such as more serious environmental pollution, more traffic accidents and more energy consumption. They drink up huge amounts of fuel and throw out huge amounts of pollutants. Traffic accidents kill thousands of people each year and cripple more. Jams waste our precious time. Therefore, I am against developing private cars.",7
"Modern technology, such as fertilizer, pesticide and modern machinery can feed the world better. However, it is negative to human health. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?","With the rapid development of science, many modern agricultural technologies, such as fertilizer and modern machinery have been applied with the view to enhance the output of produces. Undoubtedly, this increases the volume of crops. But in the meanwhile, some people show their great concerns about the negative effects aroused by modern agriculture.Firstly, the utilization of fertilizer causes great changes of the structure of soil. In the long run, this will make the soil infertile, which means that we can only have a good harvest with the help of fertilizer. Furthermore, the change of the structure of soil can cause serious environment problem.Secondly, pesticide can kill most of the insects harmful to crops. But at the same time, it also kills many insects, which are friendly to the crops and human beings. The abuse of pesticide also seriously threatens the health of human beings. When people eat the vegetable and crops with pesticide sediment, their health will be in danger and their digest system and neural system will be damaged.Finally, the use of modern machinery saves people a lot of time and energy. But this will cause serious environmental problems. In the ancient times, most of the field labor is undertaken manually or with the help of some tamed animals, such as cattle and horses. But now, modern machinery takes the place of human beings and animals and plays a major role in modern agriculture, which will cause serious environment pollution and the scarcity of natural resources.To sum up, the employment of modern technology helps to improve people's living, but meanwhile, we should raise the awareness of protecting our environment and us and takes some measures to ensure people's health.",8
Some people think that genetically modified plants may be harmful and should be banned. What do you think?,"Genetically-modified (GM) plants are part of the latest developments in our ever-changing world. Some people are against them because they are concerned that such plants may cause unpredictable problems. I believe this concern is totally unnecessary, as GM plant shave the following three advantages.First, research and development of GM plants will help us to produce better foodstuffs in terms of quantity and quality. For example, disease-resistant rice with high yields can help eradicate famines and food shortages that have been plaguing the people of many countries. With GM plant technology, we can develop fish without bones, apples that taste of meat and other delicious and exotic foods. The possibilities, to some extent, are only limited by man's imagination.Second, GM technology opens a new dimension for scientific research. Scientists have been working hard to decipher the secrets hidden in all organisms. GM plant technology will help them to better understand how nature works. Some day, I believe, we will be able to decode all plants' genetic makeup, and bring the whole plant growth process—from blossoming to fruit bearing—under our control.Third, GM plants may assist us to achieve a perfect ecological balance by producing species to cover the gaps in the biological chain due to wanton abuse of natural resources by human activities. We can develop organisms that can decompose and digest the garbage produced by mankind to make this world greener and cleaner.Of course, GM plants, like other scientific developments, may cause some problems. But I believe that, with careful regulation and control, the advantages will far outweigh the disadvantages.",8
Some people think that it is the television that makes the relationship of family members not as close as before. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"As one of the most important inventions of the past century, TV is playing a more and more important role in modern life. However, some people are starting to worry about its negative effects on traditional families. I am convinced that the existence of TV has brought about alienation among family members.First, watching TV occupies our time to communicate with our families. TV provides a ready means of relaxation for people who spend their days doing routine and busy jobs. As soon as TV enters our home, most of our free time is controlled by it. What is more, the one-eyed monster requires absolute silence and attention. If any member dares to open his mouth, the others order him to shut up immediately. Therefore we communicate less with our family members.Furthermore, families often quarrel over what programs they should watch. Thanks to hardworking TV workers, we enjoy more TV channels and more colorful TV programs. But a question has arisen: it is difficult for families to choose a common channel because they have different interests. It is inevitable to give rise to quarrel among them.In addition, poor-quality TV programs can have severe effects on people's mood and behavior. For instance, a person who watches too many idealized programs may become unrealistic. In addition, unhealthy programs which contain obscene and violent contents may Cause people's curiosity. All these things will inevitably have negative influence on the family relationship.In conclusion, I think that TV indeed has led to alienation among family members. We should be aware about the problem. Something should be done as soon as possible to protect the families from the negative effects of television. For example, we should reduce the time spent in front of the little screen and spend more time with our families together.",8
Some people think that advertisements should be restricted. Do you agree or disagree?,"Everywhere, and almost at any time, we find ourselves surrounded by all kinds of advertisements. Some people suggest that the government should impose restrictions on advertisements. But on the other hand, there are also many people who strongly advocate that advertisements should not be restricted.It is quite easy to find reasons for attacking advertising. First, it is extremely costly to put up an advertisement. TV advertising, for instance, costs more than 100,000 Yuan RMB per minute during prime time and this cost must eventually be paid by the consumers. Second, Advertisements are misleading and cheating. It is because advertisements have powerful influence that the profiteer often tricks the public by them. In addition, surplus advertisements have interfered in people's normal life. Every ten minutes a television program will be interrupted by commercials for a couple of minutes, which ruins good movies and exciting television shows.However, other people also argue in defense of advertising. In the first place, it has a valuable informative function, helping potential customers know about the characteristics and prices of products or where they can buy a particular product cheaply. In the second place, we would have to pay a great deal more if advertising did not create mass markets for products. It is precisely because of the heavy advertising that consumer goods are so cheap. Finally, advertisements also provide money for newspapers, magazines, radios and TV stations. Many kinds of media could not survive without advertisements.In my opinion, advertisements should not be restricted. They provide us with much useful information. They reduce the price of commodity. What is more, they play a crucial role in the development of media.",7
"Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which they are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays, there are lots of advertisements on television or on the streets. Some people think that the advertising boosts the sales of goods and it encourages people to buy things unnecessarily. This argument may be true. In my country, many advertising companies produce advertisements with famous and popular actors or singers. People, especially youngsters, buy goods that their favourite singer advertises, although they do not really need the products.Also, on the television screen, a product may look gorgeous and of good quality. As a result of it, people often buy goods without enough consideration. Consumers may not actually need it, but they buy goods impulsively soon after they watch the advertising. Furthermore, as many customers buy a particular product due to its advertising campaign, the other people may be affected by the trend, even if the product is not the real needs of the society.On the other hand, there are various aspects against these arguments. Moreover, it is people's choice to make a decision to buy goods. Advertising may be not a cause of customers' buying habits. Individuals have their own spending habits. If they have got enough disposable income, then the right to make a decision is given to them. No one actually can judge whether the goods sold are the real needs of the society or not. In addition, as there should be a limited amount of disposable income consumers are able to spend, people try to allocate their budgets. They cannot be simply swayed by those advertisements.In conclusion, as customers have their own strong opinions and standard of good quality goods, it is better to leave them to make their own decision in buying goods. It is fairly difficult to say everyone is swayed by advertising and buy goods impulsively. However, insensitive area of businesses such as toy industries, it may be necessary to ban advertising to those children as they have not got enough ability to control themselves or to know what they need.",8
"In some countries, advertisers persuade children to buy some goods, such as snacks, toys, and other goods. As for this phenomenon, parents object such practice on children. But some advertisers claim that there is useful information in these advertisements. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","It is a common phenomenon that an overwhelming number of advertisements regard children as the target group, and persuade them, especially their parents to buy clothes, toys and even some luxuries. Urgently, this advertising means needing a thorough examinationas[d23] for its justification.There is no doubt that such advertisements exert a repercussion on children's family. Generally speaking, children can influence the family's purchasing orientation, which is best illustrated in Chinese families where the family planning is strictly pursued. Due to this national policy in China, and adults unwilling to have more kids, children are usually spoilt and every need, even seemingly unreasonable ones, will be satisfied by their parents. Under such circumstances, some manufacturers take advantage of children's inexperience and impulsion, designing fancy advertisements to draw their attention and even cheat kids, which will drag families under unbearable economic burden.The side representing the interests of manufacturers and advertising agencies, of course, insists that there must be advertisement belonging to youngsters. According to their understanding, children can benefit from those specific advertisements just as adults do, and otherwise it is unfair in that they have no other channels to know any commodity information concerning their particular world. As for me, however, the main responsibility children assume at their age group is to acquire as much knowledge as possible, so in the future they can make a substantial contribution to society. If what they pay attention to is about fashion, then their learning efficiency is really doubted.My view is that in view of children's vulnerable mentality and weighty responsibility, advertisements for children should be limited. Even if we allow some ones, they must be public service advertisements arousing concern for social vulnerable groups rather than encouraging buying.",8
How does modern mass media such as movies or television influence people's behavior?,"The impact that modern mass media has had on our daily life, and society in general, is undeniable. Already, it can be seen that western movies are exerting influence on our youthful generations: they grow long hair regardless of their sex, commonly part of which is dyed gold；they wear jeans every season, usually the knees of which are deliberately tattered.The major means that mass media influences the public is by creating topics of discussion in the society. Mass media offers people (the consumers) issues to talk and think about. Antiwar movies such as Tears of the Sun and All Quiet On the Western Front among numerous others have been raising many questions. Is any war really to uphold justice? Is it really worthwhile that an individual makes sacrifices to his country, and at the same time ignores his own family or his personal values?Mass media also shapes our understanding of what is important, and what is not important. The important"" issues are to be found on the first pages of the newspaper or at the beginning of a television program. The ""unimportant"" stories are the ones that are not being told at all. The ""not very important"" stories are probably very short and hidden in the last pages. Even though there are critical thinking individuals in any society, they are a definite minority; the public in whole indeed lack the skills of critical thinking, and therefore they are often led by the media.In brief, mass media, by offering topics and affecting the ways in which we discuss ""the important issues"", has a strong influence on our perception of the truth, of the world or of the structure of our society. We have to admit that it has a role in our lives as a source of information, experiences, entertainment.""",8
"Some information in films, books and on the Internet has bad influence on young people and even on society. What are these bad influences and what should we do to prevent them?","Nowadays with the development of globalization media has a more and more important status in spread and communication. However, some drugs of western culture are also spread into China, just like the flies in the fresh air, and they have great blights on the juvenile.First of all, the X-rated films affect the juvenile a lot. The erotic pictures are contaminating the children's pure mind. This is a poison to their lovely lives. Secondly, the TV plays violent movies which lead the juvenile to go to the wrong way of their lives. In the recent years, if you open your TV set, many violent movies will meet your eyes everywhere. Since children's feel-ing is fragile, they cannot undergo such fierce impact. Thirdly, it seems that bad news dominates the headlines of all kinds of media. There is no doubt that the juvenile who read these magazines will have a wrong worldview.To keep our juvenile away from such ill factors and let them grow in a good environment, the government should take the following measures. Firstly, examine the movies imported carefully and limit the degrees strictly. Then tell people which kind of movie the juvenile cannot see. In the meantime forbid the unhealthy magazines and books' issue. Secondly, produce more programs which are good to juvenile on TV. They need salubrious programs and they need their own programs. Thirdly, to improve the education of juvenile not only teaches them knowledge on science and technology, but also tells them how to face difficulties. Let them become an outstanding and moral talent.In a word, there are still many disadvantages in the media and in our society, to which we must pay great attention. If we obviate them in proper ways, I believe, tomorrow will be better.",8
News editors decide what to broadcast on television and what to print in newspapers. What factors do you think influence these decisions? Do we become used to bad news? Would it be better if more good news were reported?,"The mass media, such as TV and newspapers, are the windows through which the public looks at what changes are taking place around the world. As for editors, it is really an important, but hard job to select the main news events from the hundreds of updated current items on behalf of their audience or readers, when many factors need to be considered in making such choices.First of all, the news should report the latest developments as soon as possible and editors react accordingly. What most people are concerned about is themselves and their immediate environment rather than events occurring on other distant continents, so editors also tend to present audiences with more local news. Finally, significant and unusual events are most newsworthy in the eyes of editors.On this last point, editors seem to display a preference for bad"" news over ""good"" news, because bad news is more uncommon and abnormal. Good weather is just not news, but natural disasters like floods and earthquakes, and their casualties are another selling point. Therefore, editors frequently seek to base their headlines on something appalling, such as disasters. They have done this so much that we audiences have become used to this kind of reporting.What is presented to audiences and readers directly determines what attitudes they hold towards the world. Reporting too much bad news has many negative effects, such as scaring the public and contributing to their pessimism and sense of insecurity. There is no doubt that increasing the number of good news reports would be advisable and would help to foster a more constructive and optimistic view of the world.""",8
Some people think the media should not report details of crimes to the public. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"With the crime rate hovering at high levels, the print media as well as the electronic media dedicate large proportions of their space or airtime to detailed crime coverage. Whether the media should present detailed accounts of crimes has caused serious debate. Many people believe that the news media should stop giving details of crimes. I totally agree with their view.In the first place, given the mercenary motives behind most detailed crime coverage, it is imperative that we discourage such coverage. The principal purpose of reporters covering criminal acts is to boost newspaper circulations or television ratings. Consequently, much detailed crime coverage is biased or exaggerated. It only serves to leave a multitude of citizens constantly fearful about crime.In the second place, detailed reports of crimes by the press afford the potential criminals very useful learning materials. Reporting crimes in graphic detail helps those who are in the process of planning some criminal act to perfect their plans. Drawing on the well-documented crime stories in the media, would-be criminals learn how to avoid the mistakes in their crime, which may aggravate the already soaring crime rate.In the third place, detailed reports of heinous crimes may traumatize the victims of the reported crimes. The reporters rarely consult the victims before they describe details of horrific crimes to the public. Hence, such reports become nothing more than an attempt to satisfy the curiosity of some base minds. Without the victims' consent, graphic accounts of crimes may become nightmares to them.In summary, detailed crime coverage in the media undermines our lives in several ways. I firmly believe if such reports continue to go uncontrolled, it will exert even more baneful influence on individuals, communities and societies, ",8
"Many newspapers and magazines feature stories about the private lives of famous people. We know what they eat, where they buy their clothes and who they love. We also often see pictures of them in private situations. Is it appropriate for a magazine or newspaper to give this kind of private information about people?","Generally, people read newspapers to find out about world current affairs and they read magazines to be entertained. Therefore, one would expect to find articles that feature the private lives of famous people in magazines rather than newspapers. However, nowadays, more and more newspapers include stories like these which are neither informative nor useful.In my opinion, this type of gossip about people's private lives should not be in newspapers for several reasons. Firstly, for example, the fact that Princess Diana is going out with a sportsman is not important news. Secondly, if newspapers want to publish articles about famous people they should focus on their public events and achievements. In other words, if there is an article about Princess Diana it should be about her works of charity, which will increase public awareness of important problems. In addition, journalists should make sure that they write about the facts only, not rumours[d24]. One should be able to rely on newspapers for the actual truth.Magazines, on the other hand, focus on social news. But I feel it is more acceptable for them to contain some features about famous personalities. In addition to being popular reading, these stories often benefit the stars by giving free publicity to them, thereby helping their careers. However, I also believe that magazine stories should not mention things that are too embarrassing or untrue just to attract people to buy the magazine. Sensational stories, such as these, cause great unhappiness to the people concerned.In conclusion, I think newspapers should concentrate on real news but magazines can feature some articles on people's private lives.",8
Some programs on TV are full of violence. This is having quite some negative influences on individuals and even on society. How far do you agree or disagree with the statement? Give your reasons.,"With the rapid development of science and technology, television, as a powerful invention in the 20th century, is becoming an indispensable tool in people's life. People can learn about what is happening around the world simultaneously by watching TV. However, at the same time, some programs with shots or scenes of violence begin to flood the TV screens. Young individuals, as well as the whole society, are unavoidably affected. In my point of view, most of these impacts are negative.To begin with, youngsters will imitate the scenes and actions of violence and crimes in TV programs, thus becoming criminals. No one would ever deny the inclination and ability of the youth to imitate. Seeing such kind of shots, especially when they are exposed to too much of such scenes, they would think that these are commonplace things in real life. As they know little about the law, they won't be able to know that these are crime committingand hence, they will just copy what they see and eventually break the law. There are simplytoo many such kind of examples in our actual life that we can just save the trouble to list any here.Likewise, such kinds of programs have negative influence on adults as well. Although adults possess higher ability to distinguish right from wrong and they have a stronger awareness of law, to any person, once he or she is exposed to something too much, he or she will just become numb and will only take it too much for granted. In this way, the seed of danger is sowed. Indeed, many cases of adult crimes were the result of film or TV influences.After we have discussed the negative influences of such programs on people, their impact on our society is all but too obvious. Because society is made up of people who are negatively influenced, we simply cannot bear to imagine what the entire society will be like. In fact, many real-life cases reveal that a lot of criminals learned how to rob a bank, burglarize a household and even commit a murder from TV. To prevent such things from happening, security department of the government has to hire more policemen to maintain order, thus aggravating the financial burden of the country and the government.Apparently, scenes and shots of violence in TV programs are indeed harmful to individuals and society; therefore, they should be strictly censored and controlled.",8
Some British families decide not to buy televisions because they influence the development of the creativity of children. What do you think?,"With the rapid development of science and technology, television, as a new invention in the 20th century is becoming very popular in people's life. People can be informed of the latest news and enjoy the colorful programs at home. In my opinion, television will not affect children's creativity as exaggerated.Firstly, television is the most effective tool to inform children of the latest news and scientific development over the world. Television tells us the recent development of some researches, such as clone technology, genetic breakthroughs, the new computing technology and so on, which can stimulate the imagination of children and encourage them to carry out relevant experiments, making new findings and breakthroughs in their study.Secondly, some programs like adventures and geography can enlarge children's knowledge of scope. With the emergence of information technology, the knowledge in textbooks cannot satisfy children's curiosity any more. Children need to learn wider knowledge and know more about our world. Programs like adventures can cultivate children's creativity and the ability to tackle difficulty; programs like geography can teach children knowledge about different countries in the world and initiate their aspiration to know about the nature; programs about science can inspire children's interest in science and technology.However, the improper programs on television sometimes play a negative role in the growth of children. The shots about violence, crimes and pornography contents are making children walk on the criminal road.To sum up, I believe that television will not influence children's creativity. But meanwhile, the government and the whole society should do their utmost to prohibit the unhealthy content son TV and provide the children with a clean growing environment.",8
Internet and TV technology develop very quickly nowadays. Some people say that they will take the place of radio. What's your opinion?,"Internet and TV, as the mainstream of media, play a very important role in information transformation. They present a colorful and vivid world in front of us. Some people assert that Internet and TV would take the place of radio in a couple of years. However, facts tell us that each medium has its own advantages and disadvantages. Radio will not retreat from our life.Admittedly, Internet and TV bring about many conveniences to us. Firstly, Internet and TV can transform information instantly. They can tell us what happened in the world right away with very impressive dynamic pictures. During the 17th World Football Cup, many people watched the games on TV or Internet live. Internet and TV can also tell us the latest development of science and technology and the fashion trend nowadays, which can keep us abreast with the world. Secondly, Internet and TV also play an important educational role. For instance, people can study history, culture, language and cooking skills from some educational programs. Lastly, people can get entertainment from Internet and TV, which are abundant in interesting and exciting electronic games and adventures.However, we should not neglect the advantages of radio, which is the traditional but efficient medium to the public. Radio can be installed in various kinds of places, such as bus, car, train, plane and other public places, which can transform information extensively. Radio only occupies a small space. You can even put your radio in your pocket and listen to it conveniently. Once you turn on your radio, you can always choose the favorite channel. Compared with radio, Internet and television are not so convenient. If you have no access to Internet, maybe, the best choice for you to get information is from radio. Radio is also employed as the main communication facility in wars.In conclusion, I don't think Internet and TV will take the place of radio, though they enjoy more advantages over radio. Radio is the complementation to Internet, TV and other media. It will play an important role in the future.",8

Some people hold that we should not use animals in medical experiments. Do you agree or disagree?,"Since human beings existed in the world, animals have always been accompanying us. They are of great help to humans in many aspects. For example, they help a lot in medical experiments. Many people argue that animals should not be used for testing medical techniques and drugs. Others, on the other hand, claim that without animal testing, some patients would suffer or even die from their diseases. Before rendering my opinion, I think it is more important to take a glance at the arguments on both sides.Those people who strongly believe that we should use animals in experiments have cogent reasons for it. For one thing, animal testing allows scientists to test and create new drugs. It would be cruel that some people die of a disease because there is not enough information about it. For another, at present there are no other better methods to replace animal tests. Therefore, animal tests are still regarded as the only reliable and feasible method. More importantly, animals such as monkeys or rabbits which are used in experiments are easily bred. Furthermore, most countries set standards for animal treatment in tests, and laboratories have regulations to prevent cruelty.However, further analysis would make it clear that animal testing should be halted. First and foremost, animal tests violate animals' rights. Nothing seems more brutal than taking away a life, no matter it belongs to a man or an animal. Moreover, not all the experiments are reliable. The treatment and drugs which are effective to animals sometimes are useless and even have negative effects on humans. Thirdly, not all the experiments are necessary. With the development of technology, computer simulation can achieve similar results.From the above comparison and contrast, anyone can obviously conclude that animals should not be used for testing medical techniques and drugs. As creatures, animals enjoy the same rights as humans. Information from animals does not apply to humans. What is more, other better methods have been discovered to replace animal tests.",7
Some people think that the amount of time and money spent on the protection of wild animals would be better spent in improving the well-being of humans. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Ecology is attracting more attention from a growing number of people in recent years, while some people claim that time and money should be better spent on the human beings instead of wild animals. I disagree with this viewpoint for the following reasons.First of all, wild animals have equal rights to live better in the world. The whole earth is not lived alone by human beings. Many wild animals might have lived longer than human beings have appeared.With the development of the human economy, the whole environment of the wild animals is deteriorating, which is partially due to humans' intentional catch of the wild animals to make clothing, medicine, decoration or even food.　Furthermore, the expansion of the land development reduced the habitat of the wild animals and the emission and pollution of the chemical substances spoiled the normal living conditions of the wild animals. Owing to the above reasons, human beings should be responsible for the wild animals to remedy the harm brought by us, rather than save the time and money for our own use.In the second place, wild animals are an indispensable part of the balanced nature. To spend time and money on them is for our benefit. On one hand, many wild animals, such as frogs and birds, eat pests to provide a more agreeable environment for humanity; on the other hand, wild animals are crucial part of our food chain. The absence of wild animals will endanger the lives of human beings. In addition, the research into wild animals will make us know more about ourselves and the changes of the ecology.It's wise to spend time and money on wild animals. Reasonable investment on the wildlife will bring lots of knowledge even profits for human beings. Many people visit wild life conservation zones to gain knowledge, to teach their kids, etc, which is advantageous for both wild life and human beings.",8
"Wild animals have no place in the 21st century, and the protection is a waste of resource. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","As is known to all, the big contradiction between the limitation of land and the rapidly increasing demand for it escalates an alarming headache of human beings. To improve the situation, some people suggest we instantly give up protecting wild animals, the reason for which, according to them, is simply that they believe there will be no spare places for the wild animals as their shelters or habitats in the 21st century, and thus it is nothing but a waste of resources to carry out the protection. As far as I am concerned, the so-calledsuggestion"" is extremely ridiculous and has no point at all.On one hand, wild animals are part of nature around us and to be exact a most necessary part. They are destined to become extinct without our protection, as a consequence of which, the balance of nature will undoubtedly be destroyed and it won't be long before we receive the great punishment that resulted from that. Since the old hurt on us is to be healed, why do some of us still prefer to run risk of being revenged again to break the balance of nature? Never stumble by a single stone twice, never! Remember wild animals are our intimate and faithful friends, and we humankind ought to get along with them under any circumstances.On the other hand, we have been trying every effort to settle the annoying problem, or at least to prevent the situation from deteriorating. And we have sufficient confidence and capability to fulfill the task, no matter how difficult or sophisticated it may be. Therefore, we can ensure that wild animals will not lose their shelters or habitats, even if in the 21stcentury.In general, I stick to the position that it's everybody's responsibility to enforce the protection of wild animals instead of reducing or even stopping it. Similarly, we should deal with such a crucial problem actively and bravely, instead of in a negative way.""",8
A zoo has no useful purpose. Do you agree or disagree?,"Perhaps one of the most blameworthy factors that make some people raise their eyebrows to zoos and criticize thatA zoo has no useful purpose""is the exorbitant price of maintaining them. However, it is too hasty to say so, since most zoos have their significance, both educational and scientific.Modern zoos are designed to make learning about animals an interesting and enjoyable experience. They provide visitors with the chance to see rare creatures from many different parts of the globe, offering a valuable learning experience in an urban world. Mean while, most zoos provide educational programs for a wide range of ages. A visit to a zoo provides opportunity for children to see and touch animals. For schoolchildren, many zoos conduct classes or day trips that focus on different aspects of animal biology and the impacts of humans on animal life.vModern zoos can also function as a sanctuary for endangered animals, therefore helping maintain ecosystem. An example of a successful reintroduction to the wild is a kind of Asian deer which was native to marshlands in northeast China before its habitat was destroyed more than 800 years ago. Since that time the species has been bred in zoos in China and later in Europe. In 1985 four deer were released to the wild where they are now breeding successfully.On the other hand, experts warn against placing too much reliance on zoos as biological""arks"". More significantly, the number of species that zoos can protect is strictly limited. Today's zoos are home to no more than a few thousand species. During the 21st century, zoo experts will face even harder decisions about which species they can afford to save.""",8
"Many people believe that zoos should be closed because it is cruel to keep animals locked up. Moreover, zoos do not play a positive role in society. Do you agree or disagree?","There are two sides to every story, and that includes zoos. We must admit that to imprison animals in such small spaces is something that goes against their nature. We can also say that zoos, unlike big shopping malls that can make large amounts of cash flow all the time, are burning money every day. But you imagine a decent city without a zoo?On one hand, zoos provide recreation and refreshment for fatigued urban dwellers. People relax when appreciating an elegant swan or a playful chimpanzee. This kind of relaxation is something that can not be obtained through modern entertainment means, such as karaoke or discos. It's a purely natural sensation.On the other hand, zoos are important to small children. If zoos are places of recreation for adults, then they must be dreamlands for small children. Do you remember the first time you were taken to a zoo? I'm sure it was something you'll remember all your life. Small children learn how to protect animals through observing them and this will also add to their knowledge something they will never acquire in the classroom.Finally, viewed from the scientific aspect, zoos are crucial for protecting certain rare species from extinction. For instance, the survival rate of babies of giant pandas increases when they are raised in advanced facilities in zoos. Zoos also assist research facilities to carry out harmless scientific research on animals' living patterns.In a word, we should pay more attention to our zoos instead of closing them. This will be beneficial for our planet, our descendants and ourselves.",9
Some people think killing animals for food is cruel and unnecessary while other people think it is essential for daily diet. What do you think about the both issues?,"Speaking of the attitude towards killing animals, different individuals may have different reactions and their personal opinions also vary from person to person.Some people stand against the cruel behaviour, which is not only rather foolish but also quite unnecessary to them. From my point of view, killing animals for human needs is indeed an unmerciful thing and may sound a little bit selfish. Every coin has two sides, however, as is often the case with this stupid-appearing attitude we referred to above. Obviously killing animals can bring us large amounts of useful things to satisfy our basic requirements, such as shoes made of animals' skin, food made from their flesh, etc. So it is incorrect to deny the necessity of the behaviour thoroughly and completely.Nevertheless, neither do I agree with others whose attitude is just opposite and based on the saying that animals' flesh is necessary to human beings. Frankly speaking, I feel sick of this view because it reveals that the view-holders are likely to commit anything for their own interests regardless of its bad influences. We should not kill animals for the only aim of enjoying meat, for it sounds to me more an excuse than a reasonable explanation. As technology has been developing rapidly, artificial meat becomes available, which makes the excuse sound more insensible.To sum up, I suggest we keep the killing of animals under strict and tight control, and more importantly try to turn out more products to replace using animals for our daily needs.",8
Some people think that animals should be treated as friends. Yet others only consider animals as sources of food and clothing. What is your opinion?,"There is a growing tendency nowadays for some people to treat animals as living meat and walking fur. This leads to the cruel slaughter of animals all over the world every year. Yet, in my opinion, instead of killing animals human beings should treat them as their friends.In the first place, it is an undeniable fact that animals play a vital role in maintaining the subtle balance of the earth's ecosystem. The lack of this essential part will bring about the destruction of the whole world. Therefore, to some extent, killing animals is equal to digging our own graves.Secondly, for thousands of years, many animals have given loyal service to humans. Pigeons convey messages in wartime, and dogs help to detect crime. Even pigs, which many people think are the most stupid animals, are used in the battle against drugs. There is no doubt that our lives would be far less convenient without a little help from our animal friends.Last but not least, animals also help humans in a spiritual way. There is nothing better than keeping a cat or a dog if you want your kids to be more independent and responsible. It is also noted that senior citizens live longer if they keep pets after their retirement.To sum up, animals are human beings' friends. Those who regard animals as merely a source of food and clothing should at least bear one thing in mind: Being kind to animals is being kind to ourselves. Therefore, for our own future benefits, please treat animals with love and care.",8
Some people are of the opinion that keeping pets such as cats and dogs is beneficial to city dwellers. What do you think?,"Some people are critical of keeping pets, such as cats and dogs in cities, claiming that there are simply not even open spaces for them to roam freely. They also argue that pets pollute living environments. However, I am of the opinion that owning pets is rewarding to city dwellers.First of all, they could act as companions and stress relievers and in some cases help to foster family cohesion. While they are traditionally associated with family-type households, pets are just as important to households without children; indeed they are often surrogates for children in childless families. This applies particularly to the elderly, who usually form every close associations with their pets. In an era when the population is aging and more people are living alone, pets can provide valuable relief from loneliness.In addition, pets are particularly important for children. A pet in the family keeps kids in touch with a more natural, animal world. Seeing a pet give birth brings understanding of the naturalness of childbirth, and seeing a pet die helps a child to cope with sorrow. Learning to care for a pet helps a child to grow up into a loving adult who feels responsible towards those dependent on him. Rightly we teach children to be kind to their pets. They should learn, too, that pets are good for human beings.People living in the countryside may have access to many types of domestic animals such as cows, horses, and sheep. This is simply not true in cities. Pets can provide a limited opportunity for city dwellers to get in touch with nature. This helps people to become more environmentally conscious.All in all, I strongly feel that those living in cities can benefit from having pets.",8
"In Western countries, people spend a lot of money on their pets. Some people think this is a waste of money, and argue that pets are dirty and dangerous. Do you agree or disagree?","In many Western homes people keep dogs or cats or some other kinds of pets. While this does involve some expense in terms of good food and medical treatment, there are still many advantages to keeping a pet.First of all, pets are good companions. This is especially important for people who live alone and for older people who do not go out much. Some pets can also help to protect the house from thieves. Secondly, dogs and cats like to play and can give hours of amusement to children and adults. Taking care of a pet also helps children to develop responsible attitudes and to learn about nature. Finally, the actual expense of keeping a pet is not that high, and they can eat the leftovers of family meals.Some people claim pets are dirty. I don't think this is totally true. Responsible pet owners keep their pets clean and healthy so they are not smelly. People also say that certain pets, like large dogs, can be dangerous. There have been cases of dogs attacking and seriously injuring small children. However, these cases are uncommon and are the result of bad owners. These people either don't train their dogs properly or actually encourage them to be aggressive. So, the problems of pets being unclean or dangerous are in fact the problems of the owners, not the pets themselves.To sum up, there are more advantages than disadvantages to keeping a pet, especially for lonely people and children. In most cases, therefore, the cost is justified.",8
Traffic jam is a problem in most cities all around the world at present. What causes the problem? Make some recommendations.,"Along with the rapid development of urban traffic, certain problems have arisen, one of which is the traffic jam. It has become common to see passengers and drivers having to wait in long lines of buses and cars during the rush hours. From my own perspective, there are several reasons for this problem.First, the number of vehicles is increasing much more rapidly than the building of roads. In big metropolitan cities, as the number of traffic vehicles is soaring up recently, the development of road system seems rather slow relatively. No sooner has a new road been completed and opened to public traffic than it is crowded with all kinds of vehicles. In addition, there seem to be too many private cars and not enough public buses. In most cases, a car carries only one or two people, while it occupies almost half the space a bus does.Another reason is that many people, including drivers, pedestrians and cyclists do not obey traffic rules properly, especially at busy intersections. For example, some people drive after drinking, some drive without a license, some run the red light and some surpass the speed limit. All these things undoubtedly worsen the grave situation.In view of the seriousness of this problem, effective measures must be taken before things get worse. On one hand, there is a need for the government to invest more money in the building of new roads. On the other hand, we should give priority to the development of public transportation and impose restrictions on the use of private cars in urban areas. At the same time, it is of great importance that stricter traffic rules and regulations should be issued to strengthen traffic control.",8
Some people hold that the development of modern technology leads to environmental pollution and energy shortage. Do you agree or disagree?,"Science and technology have been developing rapidly during the past ten years. Their development has brought lots of benefits to mankind. Science has changed so much of today's world. Due to the development of technology, we now live safer, more comfortable and convenient lives. However, it seems quite clear to me that while progress has brought us many time-saving machines, it has also brought us environmental pollution and energy shortage.The development of technology has been responsible for pollution. Modern industry, as well as modern traffic conveniences, has created a serious problem of air contamination. The green house effect"" is now threatening the existence of mankind. Since the population of the earth is increasing very fast, humans must make the earth support the increasing population. This has made it necessary for agriculture and industry to develop rapidly. Such a rapid development produces more and more waste, which goes into the water, the soil and the air. Some of it is made harmless. However, where there is too much of it, the poisonous waste may do great harm to the things around the people.With the development of technology, the amount and range of materials taken has increased. It is estimated that this trend will continue in the years to come. However, natural resources are not inexhaustible and some resources are already nearly used up. For example, the end of the world's fuel is already within sight. Such essential daily items as water is in short supply in many parts of the world. With the expansion of industrialization, requirement for energy all over the world is on the rise. Consequently, we have a great need for energy because of the rapid growth of our economy.From what I mentioned above, I believe that it is the development of science and technology that leads to the pollution of environment and shortage of energy.""",7
Some people believe that the earth is being harmed by human activities. Others feel that human activities make the Earth a better place to live. What is your opinion?,"The quality of human life has improved greatly over the past few centuries, but Earth is being harmed more and more by human activities. As we develop our technologies, we demand more from our planet. Eventually, this will harm people as well.Our planet gives us everything we need, but natural resources are not endless. Strip mining devastates whole regions, leaving bare and useless ground. Deforestation removes old-growth trees that cannot be replaced. Too much fishing may harm fish populations to the point where they cannot recover. We are too careless in taking what we want without giving anything back.There are more people than ever, living longer than ever. So it is no wonder that living areas suffer from too much development. Anyone living in or near a city has experienced urban sprawl"". There is a new shopping area on every corner and new houses, townhouses and apartments everywhere. Traffic gets worse and worse because planners can't keep up with growth. Keeping up with human demand is hard enough. Environmental concerns come last with the growth of pollution. Companies and communities dump waste into water. Landfills are full of trash. Emissions from factories pollute the air with industrial waste, what is worse, radioactive waste have made there no safe place to go. If we are not careful, we will harm our planet beyond repair.People need to respect the Earth and try to preserve it. If we do not, what kind of future will we have?""",8
"Technological development causes a lot of environmental problems. As for the issue, some people think a simple life style can protect environment while others argue that technology itself can solve it. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.","As the symbol of 21st century, technology has transformed nearly every aspect of our life, such as communications, traffic, and housing. Environmental pollution, however, haunts technological advance up until now. Greenhouse gas emissions from popular private cars, poisonous pollutants from modern factories, and even noise pollution from air flights have promoted us to doubt whether we have paid too much for what we have enjoyed.On one hand, if less technological applications in our life are harnessed, environmental pollution will be alleviated. There is no doubt that our life becomes comfortable and convenient with the help of advanced technology, for example, private cars and air planes, which facilitate travel substantially and enhance our working efficiency considerably. Living in one country while working in another turns out to be a common practice for employees in some multinational companies. Nevertheless, from the perspectives of climate change and noise pollution, cars and planes are the main culprits. If we can live a simple life without those conveniences, then it is greatly conducive to safeguarding our surrounding.On the other hand, perhaps with the development of technology, the harms caused will be lessened. More countries begin to realize that a deteriorating environment accompanies a comprehensive growth in people's living standards and further affects economic development. If natural environment is in a mess, no other countries will be willing to invest there, so a harmonious surrounding is the foundation for a sound development of a country. Undersuch circumstances, green technology is the future direction for every country, and the balance between technology and environment is the top priority for national policy. As for me, however, I doubt that technological leap can be really compatible with the environment, and, honestly, the possibility is slim.Taking into account our poor environment, I hope that our life can return to nature, and every one of us drives less, away from those modern inventions detrimental to environment. After all, it is easy to pollute while formidable to improve.",8
We are now living in a throw-away society. What causes the problem? Make some recommendations.,"With the rapid development of society, mankind has entered a throw-away society. We can find metal tins, plastic bags and all kinds of packages thrown away everywhere. It seems that we are addicted to a habit of throwing away anything around us as soon as it is thought useless, which is a threatening social ailment.As for me, two contributing factors can be identified. Initially, modern technology renders it possible to replace the old with the new at a faster pace. It is a fact that because great strides are achieved in science, one-off products have permeated every corner of our life. Accordingly, this so-called convenience leads to the phenomenon that the used chopsticks, shopping bags, and water bottles are littered randomly. Moreover, lack of the awareness of environmental protection exacerbates the serious problem. It is highly probable that we throw away articles not on the purpose of contaminating the environment, but involuntarily and we are blind to the relevant detriments. Therefore, gradually rubbish accumulates at an alarming rate, while environment becomes the victim to this ugly behaviour.Before our society becomes ａ waste dump, it is high time that relevant measures should be taken. Firstly, one-off products should be strictly controlled or abandoned, if possible. As we know, easy access to those products is the main culprit of the popularity of this headaching practice. Secondly, the environmentally friendly education should top the agenda of the government. Obviously, if everyone is fully informed of preciousness but fragility of environment, he or she will think twice next time as for throwing away anything.Inevitably, the satisfactory solution to the throw-away society calls for cooperation and coordination between government and individuals. In the future, it is hoped that the society will turn from a throw-away one to a recycling-oriented society.",8
Nowadays we are producing more and more rubbish. Why do you think this is happening? What can government do to help reduce the amount of rubbish produced?,"The more developed the region is, the more rubbish there is, which is perhaps the never-failing wisdom in modern civilized world. Who is the director in such a black humour?Firstly, the comfortable and convenient life accompanied by the fantastic growth of science and technology can account for the overwhelming rubbish. As we know, the pride-taking symbol of 21st century is the unbelievable technology, which provides a multitude of one-off products enjoyed avariciously by indolent people, such as chopsticks, shopping bags, and purified water bottles, some of which are non-biodegradable for ages. Accordingly, wastes have been produced and accumulated at an amazing rate. Furthermore, the awareness of environment protection is alarmingly scarce. We are addicted to entertainment of life but often refer to environment as others. In our perspective, pollution combating and nature conserving are far from our essential jobs, and government should take all the responsibility. So we can drop litter without even a grain of shame.If we hate to witness our earth is transformed into a large rubbish dump, government and individuals should take immediate steps to curb that terrible situation. The authority has to invest more money in efficient disposal of trash, and the large-scale campaign against ugly phenomenon such as random garbage-throwing and spitting should be launched without any delay. As for individuals, behaving themselves and saying no to possible environmental-unfriendly deeds are strongly recommended.Rubbish-handling is a quite complex issue, and it needs cooperative efforts from people and society as a whole. Since we were capable of turning the world into a splendidwonderland long ago, we have good reasons to believe that a clean, wonderful homeland is not far behind.",8
Individuals have nothing to do to improve the environment. Governments and large companies can do something to improve the environment. Do you agree or disagree?,"It is an undeniable fact that in recent years, environmental pollution, which becomes increasingly serious, has aroused the shared concern of countries around the world. A group of people hold the viewpoint that governments and big companies, rather than individuals, should be mainly responsible for the improvement of the environment. Nevertheless, I am inclined to believe that governments, large companies, as well as individuals should actively shoulder the responsibility of beautifying the environment. In this essay, I will demonstrate my point of view from the following aspects.Firstly, it is the responsibility of the government, representative of the people, to spare no efforts to ameliorate the environment. To be more specific, government should stage some relevant laws and regulations to severely punish factories which produce a great number of pollutants and those who litter or spit deliberately. Furthermore, large sums of money should be invested in the improvement of the environment, such as the treatment of waste water, trash recycling and so on.In addition, large companies, on the other hand, should establish the self-consciousness to minimize the possibility of creating pollutants, which may not only be beneficial to the whole country but also to the companies themselves. As an illustration, some transnational corporations are striving to explore some newly-burgeoned industries of high-tech content, high additional value and low energy consumption, taking the place of some high contaminative industries.Last but not least, it is the top priority of individuals to improve their living space. There is a popular saying which goes like this: It is everyone's obligation to protect the environment."" Most importantly, we should strengthen the consciousness of environmental protection, not only strictly being self-disciplined but also supervising people around. So to speak, it is unreasonable to claim that individuals have nothing to do with environmental protection.From what has been discussed above, we can safely draw the conclusion that government, big companies and individuals should make their due contribution to salvage the deteriorating environment.""",8
What are the causes of water shortage? Please offer some solutions to deal with this problem.,"Since the beginning of time, water has been shaping the face of the Earth. Water sustains human life, our environment and our cultures. But the global demand for water is increasing and the destruction of water-dependent ecosystem has accelerated.From my point of view, the main reason of scarcity of water resource is the rapid population growth, especially in developing countries. In order to meet the great demand for water, people exploit water resource in various ways. Water supply sources are being stretched to their limits. And surface and groundwater pollution is increasing rapidly. Research indicates that over 1 billion people still do not have access to safe water supplies and over 1.7 billion do not have access to adequate sanitation facilities.Another reason is the development of industry and agriculture. In some developing countries, some private factories make use of water resource low-efficiently and make much pollution. Irrigated agriculture also contributes to water scarcity. Despite the high yield, irrigation is extremely water intensive. It takes about 1,000 tons of water to grow one ton of grain and 2,000 tons to grow one ton of rice.Finding solutions of the problem involves the increase of worldwide awareness and international cooperation. Every individual should realize water crisis and save water. As to the government some effective measures should be taken, including erecting modern irrigation systems and increasing the number of sewage water recycling plants. Building more dams can also be an effective solution. Dams play an important role in detaining the surface rain water flowing from the mountains and would prevent the loss of rainwater straight into the sea.	8
The only way to improve the safety on the roads is to give much stricter punishments for driving offences. To what extent do you agree or disagree?	Traffic has taken the place of cancer and become the main factor in causing death. How to solve this problem is a big headache of government. The usual way is to give strict punishment for driving offence. Personally I think it is one solution, but in no way the only one.First, we have to admit that, apart from subjective factors, there are objective factors deteriorating road safety. For example, in some third world countries traffic systems are not so developed: roads are narrow and rough. All these make driving extremely difficult and thus increase the unsafe factors in traffic. Or in big metropolitan cities, as the number of traffic vehicles is roaring up recently, the development of road system seems rather slow relatively. It is common to be trapped in traffic jams. When people have to hurry to work, driving offence is unavoidable.Second, just as the proverb goes, an ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure. It is better to prevent driving offence than to give strict punishment for it. There should be more effective measures. For example, the driving test should be standardized and made far more difficult than it is. All drivers should take the test every three years. The age at which people are allowed to drive any vehicle should be raised to at least 21. All advertising stressing power and performance of cars should be banned. The government should distribute more capital in improving the road condition. We should strengthen the people's education of the sense of road safety.Strict punishment is a neither only nor good way to improve the safety on the roads. Only in the condition that other solutions cannot be exercised, should punishment be chosen.",8
Traffic is a very serious problem. The pedestrians and bicycle riders are more and more in danger. Many gardens become sacrifices to highways. What are the best ways to make the citizens satisfied?,"Traffic problem becomes the biggest concern of many countries in the world, not only because of the environmental pollution caused by the exhausted gas and irritating noise, but also the menace it takes to the bicycle riders and pedestrians. Furthermore, many gardens and grasslands give way to the rapid development of traffic facilities like highway, flyovers and avenues, leaving less and less space for the citizens.Admittedly, the development of road construction stimulates the prosperity of economy. For example, the increasing employment rate, the sales of the private cars and the hightaxes levied on car owners are what a government expects. But as a responsible government, it should have a long-term development plan instead of the pursuit of a short-term profit. A responsible government should always give priority to people's appeal.To make the citizens satisfied, firstly, the government should preserve for the citizens more gardens and meadows, where people can spend weekends with their friends and family. Gardens and meadows can also purify the polluted air, creating a good environment for the citizens. Secondly, the government should encourage the use of public transport and limit the ownership of private cars. Due to the economic development, many citizens can afford a private car. Take Shenzhen as an example, the sales of private cars increase by 5,000 every month. It is hard to imagine if the current roads can accommodate so large a number of cars five or ten years later. Finally, the government should consider the relation between economic development and environmental protection, leaving more green lands to our descendants.To sum up, economic development and environmental protection do not contradict each other. If a government is responsible, it should make no efforts to give people a comfortable living environment and dedicate itself to economic development as well.",8
Moving large companies and factories with their employees to the countryside could solve traffic and housing problems in major cities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Like a disease that troubles the patients, traffic and housing problems in almost every metropolis are what governments must address without any delay. But, how? One theory claims big companies and factories should be moved to the hinterland. Although it sounds plausible, the theory is not essentially flawless.To begin with, it is entirely wrong to attribute city housing and traffic problems to big companies and factories. Why? The area that big companies and factories occupy usually accounts for the less than 15% of the whole city state. Hence, big companies and factories contribute little to housing and traffic problems. Moreover, the number of the employees of big companies and factories is not large enough to give rise to traffic and housing problems.Next, to move big companies and factories does not solve the housing and traffic problems completely. In fact, it harms rather than helps city economic development by shifting the problems from city to countryside. Once the big companies and factories are moved to the suburb, schools, banks, hospitals, raw material supplies and the like will also stream into the countries. When the system becomes a flood, a new city comes into being. Then, the old problems reappear in the new cities"". In addition, these big companies and factories trigger and lead the city economic development. To remove them, product and services are expensive. Hence, to move them to the countryside makes little sense.To sum up, I do not agree that big companies and factories should be moved to the countryside. To solve the problem more effectively and efficiently, the government and scholars should consider more insightfully and seriously.""",7
"In some countries, the national traditional arts are facing extinction. Some people think that the government should support them. Do you agree or disagree? What should the government do?","Traditional arts, as valuable cultural relics of a nation, are disappearing far away from the modern society. Some people hold the view that the government should not subsidize the traditional arts. They point out that supporting traditional arts will definitely lay a great financial burden on the government. As for me, I can hardly share this point of view. I believe that I have found some solid reasons.One of the most attractive points is that traditional arts are national treasures. They are the precious heritage of our ancestors. As the offspring, it is our responsibilities and obligations to inherit them and carry them down to the next generation. China, as one of the highly-civilized countries in the world, abounds in various forms of traditional arts, such as Beijing Opera, Chinese painting, and calligraphy, which are not only our national cultural treasures, but also a rich fortune of the world.There is another factor that deserves some words here. Traditional arts are the foundation of modern ones. In other words, the development of modern arts depends upon the traditional ones. For example, compared with movie, drama is a traditional art. Many famous movie stars have ever studied in drama institutions.Some people may say that supporting traditional arts is to sink money. In fact, these traditional arts are certainly not a money waster. They are potentially profitable. There arealso a lot of traditional art fans who are willing to pay and even donate for them. In addition, the profits can last a longer time.Taking all these factors into consideration, we may reasonably come to the conclusion that the government should support traditional arts. Firstly, there is a need for the government to invest more funds on the research of traditional arts. Secondly, the government should organize activities to promote public awareness of the importance of traditional arts.",7
The 21st century has begun. What changes do you think this new century will bring?,"Mankind has made great progress since scientific exploration began, and this progress seems to be accelerating. In the last hundred years we have seen inventions that have not only greatly improved our lives but changed our lifestyles. There is no reason to believe that this rapid progress will not continue in the 21st century. While there is no way to predict exactly what our scientists and entrepreneurs will come up with, there are indications that advances will be made in certain areas. The following are some examples.First, advances will continue to be made in the field of medicine that will allow people to live longer and healthier lives. In developed countries today most people already have a lifespan that would have been unusually long a hundred years ago. Steady progress has been made in the eradication of disease and this should continue in the next 100 years。 In addition, biotechnology in the field of genetics may someday allow us to develop bodies that are stronger and free of inherited defects. Perhaps we will even be able to clone ourselves. No matter what form these advances take, it is highly likely that we will greatly extend our lifespan in the new century.Second, new technology has already brought people around the world closer. This trend will continue in the 21st century as communication becomes more efficient and affordable. Countries and their peoples have formed stronger bonds both economically and politically, as in the recent development of the European Union. Perhaps some day in the future there will cease to be national boundaries. However, one side effect of this globalization is that many characteristics of individual cultures will be lost. Sadly, by the end of the century, some languages and art forms may only be found in museums.Third, we can expect a growing population and demands for a higher standard of living to put increasing pressure on the earth's resources. We have already seen some of the effects of this pressure in the form of pollution and global warming. (It is likely that these trends will also continue and that more damage to the environment will be done.) On the other hand, perhaps we will find more efficient ways to make use of the available resources or develop alternative forms of energy. In that case, we may live in better harmony with nature.The scenarios above are just three of the many possible changes that this new century will bring. We can expect to see great advances in many fields, including medicine, communications, trade, transportation and production. Although there may be problems in the future, our ingenuity and inventiveness will help us to deal with them.",8

What kind of changes would you like to see?","We having entered the 21st century, the world is witnessing many earth-shaking changes. However, some severe problems have attracted our attention. Frankly speaking, I am always amazed when I hear people say that we should be optimistic about the 21st century. From my point of view, there is much to be done to make the world better.The dazzling development of technology is a good case in point. With technology accelerating, advances and challenges go side by side. Computers have relieved people from hard manual work, but they have also encouraged people to live in a virtual world. The Internet has provided people with a colourful world, but it has also given risen to new types of crimes. Media have reshaped the way people obtain information, but they have also been responsible for people's laziness and inactive thinking. Mobile phones have promoted people's communication and connection, but they have also invaded people's privacy. Private cars have made it easy for us to move from one place to another, thus saving our precious time, but they have also polluted the environment and killed millions of people. The utilization of nuclear power has to a considerable degree relieved energy crisis, but it has also posed a threat to the world peace.If I were asked what changes should be in the 21st century, my answers would go as follows. In the first place, I hope that there will be long-lasting peace rather than war. Second of all, I hope that there will be less pollution and starvation. In addition, I hope that everybody can enjoy high-quality education and be oneself. Finally, I hope that cultural differences should be respected and discrimination will be eliminated thoroughly.As Charles Dickens once wrote, It was the best of times, it was the worst of times."" Maybe, this is the real world in which we live.""",8
"Some people prefer to spend their lives doing the same things and avoiding changes. Others, however, think that change is always a good thing. Discuss both views and give your own opinion","Over the last half century the pace of changes in the life of human beings has increased beyond our wildest expectations. This has been driven by technological and scientific breakthroughs that change the whole way we view the world on an almost daily basis. This means that change is not always a personal option, but an inescapable fact of life, and we need to constantly adapt to keep pace with it.Those people who believe they have achieved some security by doing the same, familiar things are living in denial. Even when people believe they are resisting changes themselves, they cannot stop the world around them from changing. Sooner or later they will find that familiar jobs no longer exist, or that the safe patterns of behaviour are no longer appropriate.However, reaching the conclusion that change is inevitable is not the same as assuming that changing is always for the better. Unfortunately, it is not always the case that new things are promoted because they have good impacts for the majority of people. A lot of innovations are made with the aim of making money for a few. This is because it is the rich and powerful people in our society who are able to impose changes(such as working conditions or property development) that are in their own interests.In conclusion, I would say that change can be stimulating and energizing for individuals when they pursue it themselves, but that all changes, including that which are imposed on people, do not necessarily have good outcomes.",8
"Some people enjoy changes, and they look forward to new experiences. Others like their lives to stay the same, and they do not change their usual habits. Which approach do you prefer?","I believe that life is a river, with every destination having a unique purpose. Change is but a minor part of life and whatever the change, it will be for the best.People vary, and that is why you often find various approaches to life. For those who are content with the direction their life is heading, the idea of change would probably send shivers through them. This is due to the fact that they are at a point where they are satisfied with the way they have maximized their God-given potential. That is a positive reason for dreading change.Others dread change due to the fact that they are too scared to try or adapt to new experiences. Taking into consideration the fact that we are all human, fear is a normal feeling. The only disadvantage is the fact that unless you try, you will never know what you could have accomplished, or how well and capable you are to move on. No chance to discover the courage you have within to accept defeat but never stop trying. This is a negative reason for dreading change.Habits can be addictive, and so the main question here is whether they are positive,  beneficial habits or negative ones. By that, I mean that the choice is up to the individual. If the change is from the negative to the positive, then there is no reason whatsoever that one should dread making a change. Doing right is never wrong.In conclusion, change can either mould you or break you. I would rather try and change for the better, than live my life knowing that I never tried. Within every human being, there is a hidden potential that only change can help maximize. The question however is, whether we will give change a chance. It is all up to you, the individual!",8
"Some people enjoy changes, and they look forward to new experiences. Others like their lives to stay the same, and they do not change their usual habits. Compare these two approaches to life. Which approach do you prefer? Explain why.","It has been said that man is largely a creature of habit. We all develop routines and habits in our everyday lives, whether we are aware of it or not. To some people these routines are very important and even a small change, such as missing the morning paper, can affect the way they feel all day. Other people dislike routines and change their habits often in order to ward off boredom. They may even go so far as to change their residence or job frequently. These two different approaches to life are extremes, but each has advantages and disadvantages.In the first case, for people who dislike changes, a dependency on routines and habits can provide a sense of security and convenience, but it can also be limiting. Routines provide security because people do not have to wonder what will happen. In this rapidly changing world, it is sometimes reassuring to have a schedule to follow. Habits also make life more convenient because people do not have to think about what they must do next and do not need to worry about forgetting something. They can go through their daily routines automatically. However, this way of life is limiting when people are too dependent on their routine. They may not only be upset when things do not go according to plan, but also miss many good opportunities to try new things.In the second case, for people who seem to thrive on changes, there are also advantages and disadvantages. First of all, this kind of person is usually more open to new ideas. He can, therefore, learn more and experience more. In addition, because he is not afraid to make changes in his life and take risks, he is more willing to take advantage of unexpected opportunities. This may lead him to a previously unforeseen success. But if a person is always seeking ways to change his life, he may not stick with things long enough to gain the most benefits from them. If he lacks the necessary determination and perseverance, it will be difficult for him to succeed by any means other than luck.In my opinion, both of these lifestyles are too extreme. Most people are not so dependent on their habits, nor are they addicted to change. For me, a lifestyle somewhere between these two is ideal. I find some habits and routines comforting and convenient, yet I do not want to be afraid to face changes or take advantage of unforeseen chances to improve my life. Therefore, I will continue to follow my routine in daily life, but keep my eyes open for opportunities.",8
Learning about the past has no value for those of us living in the present. Do you agree or disagree?,"People live in the present. They plan for and worry about the future. History, however, is the study of the past. It is undeniable that learning about past has its value. It will help us understand people and societies, and it will help us understand changes and how the society we live in came to be.In the first place, history offers tons of information about how people and societies behave. For example, how can we evaluate war at peace time without historical materials? How can we understand the influence of technological innovation, or the role that beliefs play in shaping family life, without using the experiences? Consequently, history as our laboratory, and data from the past must serve as our most vital evidence to figure out why our complex species behaves as it does in social settings. That is why we cannot stay without history: it offers evidential base for the contemplation of how societies function, and people need to have some sense of how societies function to run in own lives.The second reason why history is inescapable as a subject of study follows closely on the first. The past causes the present, and so does the future. Any time we try to know why something happened—whether a shift in political party, a major change in suicide rate, or a war in the Balkans or the Middle East—we have to look for factors that took shape earlier. Only through studying history can we grasp how things change. Only through history can we begin to comprehend changes；and only through history can we understand what elements of an institution or a society persist despite change.In conclusion, I totally disagree with the argument that learning about the past has no value for those of us living in the present.",8
"When people move to another country, some of them decide to follow the customs of the new country. Others prefer to keep their own customs. Compare these two choices. Which one do you prefer?","When people move to another country, they not only face a different environment and language, but also different customs. Every culture has its own customs, and all of them are valuable. However, deciding how to deal with the problems of unfamiliar customs is a challenge for many immigrants. Some choose to follow the customs of their new country,while others prefer to adhere to their own customs. Each of these choices has some advantages as explained below.When people choose to follow the customs of their adopted country, they may find that it helps them to adapt more quickly to the new society. They have something to discuss and share with their new neighbours, and sharing customs is one way for people to feel closer to one another. Thus, following the new customs may help immigrants feel more at home. It may also help them to see the positive things in their new environment and to forget their feelings of homesickness.On the other hand, those who choose to continue following their own customs may also find that it helps them feel more at home. There are many things to adjust to in another country, and following their traditional customs may help people feel more secure in the new surroundings. More importantly, our customs are a part of us. They are an expression of the culture that has shaped us. This is something that most of us would like to pass down to our children and share with others. Sharing our old customs can also bring us closer to our new neighbours.To sum up, our customs have value and are an important part of our culture. Therefore, I don't believe that we should abandon our traditional customs when we move to another country. At the same time, I believe that we should learn about the customs of our new home and follow those that appeal to us. In this way, we can remember and celebrate our old culture while adapting to our new one.",8
Some people think visitors to others countries should imitate local customs and behaviours. Some people disagree; they think the host country should welcome cultural differences. What do you think?,"The tourist trade is booming. Systems of communication by air, sea and land make it possible for us to visit each other's countries at a moderate cost. Some people think that, when we are in a foreign country, we should maintain our own cultural custom. Others hold that we should try our best to communicate with the local people. As far as I am able to judge, I am for the latter opinion.The aim of travel is not only for relaxation and sightseeing but also for understanding. With the frequent contact between people from different places and different nations, the exchange of culture and science is sure to be promoted. It may lead to a better understanding of people all over the world.Unfortunately many tourists deliberately protect themselves from too much contact with the local people. They live at international hotels and a strict schedule makes it impossible for them to wander off on their own; and anyway, language is always a barrier, so they are only too happy to be protected in this way.The sad thing about this situation is that it leads to the persistence of national stereotypes. We do not see the people of other nations as they really are, but as we have been brought up to believe they are. When we travel abroad, we should make as many friends as possible with local people, learn the local culture and respect the local custom. Then we will find how absurd and harmful national stereotypes are.Stereotypes can be positively dangerous. They stir up racial discrimination and blind us to the basic fact that all people are human. We are all similar to each other and at the same time all unique.",8
"Some people believe that when a country begins to develop its science and technology, the traditional technology and methods are bound to die out. Therefore, the maintenance of the traditional technology and methods is futile. What do you think?","Recently, the issue regarding the future of traditional technology and methods in the midst of the rapid development of science and technology has been in the limelight. Some people argue that the traditional technology and methods are bound to die out, hence the futility of maintaining them. On the other hand, some people firmly believe that the traditional technology and method will survive the technological revolution. As far as I am concerned, the latter opinion carries more weight.For one thing, being traditional is quite different from being out of date or obsolete. Tradition is what we inherit from our forefathers, and its being handed down from generation to generation itself proves its capacity to survive. Only those things that have weathered arduous trials time after time can be called tradition; otherwise, they are something obsolete.For another, the survival of traditional technology and methods does not mean that they linger on in a steadily worsening condition. On the contrary, their existence tends to propel and even accelerate the development of science and technology. If we compare the development of science and technology to the construction of a modern building, the traditional technology and methods can be likened to the foundation. Without a solid foundation, the building is destined to collapseIn addition, the development of science and technology originates in traditional technology and methods. Thus, development itself does not exclude tradition, but requires its assistance.In a word, development and technological renovation can only be accomplished on the basis of traditional technology and methods. From what has been discussed above, we may safely arrive at the conclusion that traditional technology and methods are far from obsolete, and are bound to contribute more to the development of science and technology.",8
"With the development of society, customs and habits have changed a lot. Is it a good or bad phenomenon? What's your opinion?","With the development of society, customs and habits have changed a lot. For example, Chinese people used to have the habit of calling on each other or exchanging presents during festivals, but with the modern conveniences and facilities such as the telephone and the computer and people's greater concern for privacy, they would choose to communicate by telephone or e-mail now. Are these changes good or bad?People who oppose the changes hold that some long-cherished precious traditions are lost with the changes of customs and habits such as the above-mentioned examples. Despite the conveniences, modern technology also brings side effects. Modern people are more and more isolated and indifferent to each other. Furthermore, these people are worried that changes of customs and habits imply the betrayal of our forefathers, our past, and our history. They also point out that people are morally deteriorating with the loss of tradition. Material gains are much valued than spiritual ones, which may eventually give rise to a national crisis.Indeed, the changes of customs and habits have many disadvantages, but in the meantime there exist advantages to these changes. Firstly, some customs and habits came into being only because of people's superstition and ignorance. This kind of customs has brought more harm than good to the society and the nation. The customs of giving lucky money in the Spring Festival and holding large dinner parties at wedding lay a heavy economic burden on people. Secondly, many old-fashioned customs do not respect human rights and distort human nature. Even today some Arabic countries still keep the customs of killing the female family members who are sexually abused by villains, for the disgrace they bring to the family.In conclusion, I think it is a good phenomenon that customs and habits have changed. New customs and habits can make people's communication more efficient, and they allow people to communicate with each other in an equal, natural and simple manner. New customs and habits have created more opportunities for women such as education, employment and management. With the advance of society, all people will enjoy a better life.",8
"Now many people are forgetting their history and culture, so some people suggest that we should encourage people to wear their traditional clothing every day. Do you agree?","Some people suggest that we should wear our traditional clothing every day, since many people are forgetting history and culture. As far as I am concerned, this proposal seems a bit absurd and ridiculous.Nobody should ignore and forget our brilliant history and gorgeous culture. Without doubt, traditional clothing is part of our cultural heritage as well as a symbol of our civilization. In many people's eyes, the traditional clothing is elegant and graceful, with which I am totally in agreement. But it doesn't mean that old-fashioned dresses are suitable for our work and life in the present-day modern society.We are living in a brand new era, full of challenges and opportunities. With the tempo of people's living and working speeding up, people have to hurry up to work on weekdays, and go outdoors to exercise or relax themselves on weekends; therefore there are different sorts of clothes for different functions and occasions. Furthermore, it is a superficial way to encourage people to wear traditional clothes with the aim of remembering history and culture. I don't think it works as some advocates expect.The campaign to make sure not to forget our history and culture calls for long-term efforts. People can be better cultivated through comprehensive education in history and culture. When people are learning more about history and culture, their pride and curiosity will be aroused. I believe that this kind of education will play a crucial role in keeping people remembering the past and benefit the future generations. Moreover, we should adopt a correct attitude toward the past, that is to say, to absorb the essence and reject the dross.In a word, I can hardly share the proposal that people should be encouraged to wear the traditional clothing every day in order to preserve history and culture. However, on some special occasions such as during Chinese traditional festivals, it is acceptable to wear traditional costumes, which adds colour to the festivity.",8
"Nowadays, the trend of fashion changes very rapidly, and gradually people become the slaves of it. Some people think that a person should choose comfortable clothes, which he or she likes, regardless of fashion, do you agree? Write an essay to state your opinion.","One of the most fickle things in modern society is fashion. Fashion leaders are constantly inventing new trends in clothing and decoration, and consequently a great amount of time and money is spent on this endless pursuit. To correct this human feeling, some people advocate that one should wear comfortable clothes which are in line with one's personal taste. To me, this is a very sensible idea.We all admit that clothing should be able to illustrate a person's individual characteristics. Everyone has the right to seek his or her unique style, instead of surrendering to the latest fashion. If you want to be different from others, you should not follow the fashion; you should have your own style. Following the latest fashion trend only makes you a tiny drop in an ocean of people.At the same time, we should be clear that the basic function of clothing is to keep us warm and comfortable; therefore, it is stupid to choose clothes which may be pleasant to our eyes, but are tortured to wear. The impression we make on others is often important, but it can never be important enough to make us willingly undergo discomfort.In a word, it is unwise to follow the trend of fashion aimlessly. To be relaxed, modern people, we should form our own style and wear clothes that make us comfortable and self-confident.",8
"Modern buildings are appearing in large numbers, some people believe that we should build our buildings in traditional styles. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Large cities in the world are just construction sites all year round and many modern buildings, especially skyscrapers with glass walls, are being erected here and there. Buildings in traditional styles have given way to all these modern giants. From my own perspective, this is an avoidable trend if we wish to house more people and host more offices as more and more people are swarming into cities.In the first place, modern buildings can house more people and host more offices. We know that a modern building can be as high as over 100 stories, thus, with the same land base, far more rooms are created by directing the construction upward. This is particularly necessary when we take into consideration the fact that the population explosion has made large cities more crowded than ever before and land prices are rocketing to ever broken records with each passing year.In the second place, modern buildings can make valuable tourist resources. In fact, many skyscrapers have become the symbols of some metropolis around the world and a visit to them becomes a must. For example, the Oriental Pearl Television Tower and the Jinmao Tower, two symbols of Shanghai with a height of over 400 meters, have attracted millions of visitors every year, bring in a huge amount of money.Admittedly, traditional buildings have their own advantages when compared with modern concrete structures. They are more like homes, cozier and more convenient. There is no need for one to press a button and then wait for a long time in order to be elevated to a certain story or vice versa. And people don't have to worry about a power failure which will bring so much trouble to going up and down. However, it would be a mere fantasy to expect large cities to develop in such a way with available land areas shrinking at amazing rates nowadays.Therefore, building more modern buildings in our cities seems to be the only way out in providing more rooms for city dwellers and all kinds of business firms and offices.",8
What are your opinions about the advantages and disadvantages of "fast food" and "traditional food"?,"When we talk about fast food, we are referring to food such as hamburgers, chips, etc., that can be cooked easily, and is generally sold by restaurants to be eaten quickly or taken away, while traditional food"" is elaborately prepared, usually at home, using traditional methods.Fast food, as its name implies, is usually quick to prepare. When making sandwiches, for example, you take a slice of ham plus two pieces of bread and put them together-that's all there is to it. This presents a great advantage in this fast-moving modern society. It saves you a lot of time, so that you can devote more energy to your work and gain a competitive edge. Moreover, sandwiches are easy to make, and you don't have to be a good cook to prepare your lunch or dinner. The ingredients are ready-made, and all you have to do is to put them together. However, some people frown on fast food, believing that it is less tasty and less nutritious. Some people even call fast food ""junk food.""On the other hand, traditional foods generally involve elaborate preparations. Because of all the efforts you invest in the preparation of such meals, they usually look and taste better, which may enhance your appetite. The cooking of traditional food accommodates a number of factors, such as color, smell and taste, and most importantly, nutrition. Besides, the cuisine that is related to traditional food is part of any culture. But the cooking of traditional food tends to be time-consuming, involves the use of utensils and takes time to learn. On top of all this, traditional meals are usually much more expensive than fast food.Fast food started out as an expedient to cater to those who can't afford the time to cook or the expense of traditional food. Now it has become part of our life. Like it or not, it is here to stay. On the other hand, traditional food is an inalienable part of our culture, which we can't afford to give up. So, all in all, the co-existence of the two kinds of foods only makes our life more colorful.""",8
"Several languages are dying out every year. However, some people do not think it is important and claim that our life will be simpler with fewer languages. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Language extinction is so alarming that it has elicited a heated discussion. As for me, I doubt that our life will be simplified and beautified as some languages lose popularity.Admittedly, various communication tools have inevitably posed a severe threat to a smooth and harmonious exchange among distinct countries where languages are differentiated. As a result, maybe misunderstanding or even conflict will ensue due to lack of a thorough understanding. However, resorting to depriving some languages of existence to solve that problem of communication is far from a perfect methodology.As we know, language is the representative of a nation's particular culture, so the disappearance of the former will lead to a void culture. A language, no matter oral or written, is a definite carrier of fantastic and shimmery civilization accumulated after a series of generations of a country, hence certifying the substantial power of culture. How can we tolerate the extinction of language, or specifically culture? Moreover, what culture signifies is the characteristic root of a nation. Language dying gradually out means a rootless culture, so a nation will be not an entity in a true sense.Furthermore, if there are only a small number of languages in the world, how monotonous it is! Each language is the embodiment of the essence of a race, which is absolutely distinctive from others.It is the charismatic attraction of various languages that spice up the whole world and thus traveling to the different is the favorite to modern people. Let us imagine what will happen if several or only one language can be heard wherever we go. It is terrible indeed.From the above-mentioned discussion, it is conceded that language dying out is beneficial to our life to some extent, yet I am convinced that the drawbacks of the phenomenon have overshadowed the advantages offered. It is not, or will not be reasonable to sacrifice language to attain a smooth communication.",8
What are the reasons for losing a variety of languages and cultures?,"Nowadays people all over the world, especially the young people seem to live in the same way. They drink Coco-Cola, eat McDonald's hamburgers, and see the movies such as Star Wars, made by Hollywood. Instead of their own country's traditional festivals, they even celebrate the Christmas. It is an undeniable fact that we are losing the variety of language and culture. In my opinion, there are two main reasons.The alarming increase of people's enthusiasm of learning English accounts mainly for this issue. In China, the number of people who study English is on the rise. For going abroad or seeking for a good career, some university students even spend more than half of their studying time on this foreign language. As a result, they neglect the learning of their own country's language and culture. They have little time to read books, magazines and newspapers written in Chinese, their own national language. No matter whether their English is fluent or not, they cannot express their ideas in Chinese very well. I am one of them. When I prepare for IELSTS writing, faced with some topics, within 40 minutes, I even fail to write them in Chinese.The loss of variety of language and culture also attributes to the development of tourism. The tourist trade is booming. Superb systems of communication by air, sea and land make it possible for us to visit each other's countries at a moderate cost. What was once the grand tour"", reserved for only the very rich, is now within everybody's grasp.Therefore, a greater understanding develops between the nations of the world. That is to say, while the foreign ways introduced by travelers have a deep influence on the local people, the visitors are also deeply influenced by the local culture.Flowers with different colors make a garden more beautiful. Thus, effective measures must be taken to deal with the loss of variety of language and culture.""",8
Do you think there is the necessity of creating a new global language? Give specific reasons and examples.,"Maybe there are people who believe that there is the necessity of creating a new world language. They may also give all kinds of reasons for doing so. However, no matter how sound these reasons are, I'm convinced I won't accept them. Let me convey my mind more clearly: I don't think there's any necessity to create a global language.First of all, English has, in fact, become a global language. Nowadays, English-speaking countries are the most developed in almost every aspect and English has accordingly become the most influential language in the world. Statistics show that English accounts for80% of the world's entertainment language such as movies, television and music. It also takes up 75% of the world's IT language. It can be said that there are a large proportion of people in almost every country around the world who are learning English for reasons ranging from job hunting considerations to international-exchange necessities. There's no exaggeration that people who don't know English will find it increasingly difficult to survive.Moreover, facts have proved that it is extremely time and energy consuming to learn a new language. In fact, someone has long created one and has made great efforts for people to learn to use it. It is Esperanto. However, this effort has turned out to be in vain because not too many people really learnt it or used it. Why so? The reason is simple: any foreign language needs years of industrious efforts to learn well with the only exception of one's mother tongue, which is usually acquired in a natural manner and in a natural environment.All in all, it is just unwise to create a new world language.",8
"At present many people think that one language should be used as the common language, but others think that by doing so the cultures of different nations will be lost. What do you think of these two opinions?","These days, there is an increasing number of scholars who hold the opinion that, with the development of globalization, we need a common language to be spoken by all the people in the world, however other scholars are afraid that this will weaken other languages and cultures at the same time. As for me, I am not in favor of the viewpoint that one language should replace others as the common one.In the first place, nowadays it is universally acknowledged that language is not only a tool of communication but also a kind of art. Each language, no matter what kind of language it is, it has its unique pronunciation, grammar and expressions, which contribute to the diversity of the world. So, if the diverse languages are diminished, our world will become less colorful.In the second place, we can say that language is a part of culture, and plays a considerably important role in it. Indeed, some social scientists consider it the keystone of culture. Without language, so the argument goes, culture would not be possible. On the other hand, language is influenced and shaped by culture; it reflects culture. In the broadest sense, language is the symbolic representation of a people, and it comprises their historical and cultural backgrounds as well as their approach to life and their ways of living and thinking. Cultures differ from one another, and each culture is unique. There is no denying the fact it will be a disaster for us to see the world's diverse cultures disappear one by one.When all the factors are examined, we may safely come to the conclusion that although we are convinced that, no matter what our career choice is, a command of foreign languages is an important skill to acquire, yet we should protect our own language, the carrier of our culture.",8
"Differences between countries have become less evident. For example, nowadays the same films, fashions, brands and TV programs are found worldwide. To what extent do you think the disadvantages of this outweigh its advantages?","Globalization creates conditions for widening international exchanges and strengthening mutual understanding between nations. It expands cultural, educational, and scientific cooperation between countries. It encourages the process of modernization and the enrichment of national culture. However, I believe the disadvantages of this outweigh its advantages.Globalization creates the possible danger of diminishing the national culture and exerts a negative impact on the preservation of national identity. Through globalization and an open door policy, erroneous concepts and a lowering of ethical standards, a selfish andindividualistic lifestyle and harmful cultural products can easily be imported into the country. At present, modern information technology which in the main is controlled by US is hourly and intensively disseminating US ideology, way of life, and culture across the world. Even US food is promoted so that some people consider globalization as global Americanization.During the process of economic globalization, inequality between developed and developing countries has been increasing and the gap between the rich and the poor has become wider. Globalization goes to assist developed countries. Globalization does not pose equal interests and risks to all nations. With an overwhelming advantage compared with most of the developing countries in terms of finance and the level of science and technology, developed capitalist countries control the situation of economic globalization.For these reasons, globalization is a fierce and complicated struggle in both cultural and ideological fields. As the proverb says, fire is a good servant, but a bad master. We take the initiative in international economic integration but also have to take the initiative in fighting to prevent our distinct culture from cross-bred phenomena.",8
Will the popularity of English and tourism harm the minorities and minor languages?,"Economic globalization benefits the world immensely, especially the prosperity of tourism. As a result, the cultures, languages and customs in the minorities are not mysterious to the world any more, which should be attributed to the popularity of tourism.It is a consensus that tourism can stimulate the economic development in a region, since tourism plays an important role in the acceleration of the improvement of service, such as transportation, accommodation, catering and other marginal business. With a view to attracting more tourists, the minority regions have to consider how to improve their image and service, during the course of which they can have an overall plan to promote the status of their region. Nowadays, many people travel for minority regions to satisfy their curiosity, where they can have unexpected findings.Furthermore, tourism can strengthen the interflow of cultures and traditions between the people in different regions. Trips to minority countries and regions render people a lot of new cultures and customs, which, presumably, have been handed down from old ages and enjoyed very splendid history. Formerly, people can only get some segments about the minorities from videos, films and other incomplete descriptions on books. Now, tourists have more opportunities to communicate or even live with the minority people and acquire first-hand knowledge about them, which provides the researchers with a lot of authentic information.Admittedly, tourism damages the natural environment in some minority regions and spoils the peaceful life of them to some degree due to their frequent activities in the minority regions, the environment being deteriorated in some regions, which is not what we expected.Generally, the popularity of English and tourism brings more advantages than damage to the minority regions, since it has enriched people's knowledge and widened their horizons. But meanwhile, we should be on the alert for the damage to the minority regions and take effective means to tackle the problems tourism arouses.",8
International tourism has become one of the biggest industries in the world. Some people think it unfortunately causes a lot of tension rather than understanding between people from different cultures. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The ever-increasing living standards make it possible that people can travel abroad, appreciating fascinating exotic cultures. Some people, however, point out that this exchange exerts a more negative impact on the relationship among people with different cultures and people tend to be more hostile towards each other. As for this assertion, I am rather doubtful.It is generally agreed that the booming tourist industry can boost local economic development considerably. When people travel to a place of attraction, they will visit local shops, dine in restaurants and seek accommodations, which not only provides opportunities of making money, but also improves employment rate. If tourists can bring such benefits to host countries, then there is no doubt that they are warmly welcome, and a mutual understanding is likely to be established.Moreover, through international travel, the platform of exchange can further tolerate feelings among different people. For example, when foreigners come to China, perhaps they will be startled when people greet each other with Have you dined?"", but gradually they know the true meaning is nothing more than a common concern showing social politeness. If similar phenomena occur frequently, so-called misunderstanding or culture shock will definitely come into non-existence.Granted, international travel contains the potential threats such as environmental pollution and violation of cultural tattoos, which maybe tarnish tourist images. It is true that some travelers lack the awareness of environmental protection, throwing away rubbish anywhere they go. Meanwhile, due to being blind to local traditional customs, some people even arouse strong enmity from people in destination. Those undesirable practices, nevertheless, can be corrected through suitable education.Overall, with the need to know more about the rest of the world and the high mobility modern transportation ensures, more people love international tourism. After all, travel is an indispensable part of human life.""",8
Sports events such as the World Cup may help reduce the tension between and bias towards countries. Discuss.,"There is no doubt in my mind that sports events which pit one country's athletes against another's can promote world peace. For one thing, they channel aggressive instincts into harmless competitions. For another, the spirit of sportsmanship dictates that one's opponent is not one's enemy, but a partner whose opposition helps to raise the level of one's skill. Moreover, a defeated opponent is not to be despised but to be honored, so long as he or she has played the game fairly and made every effort to win.However, there is a dark side to international sports events these days. Many such competitions are funded by giant corporations, who regard them simply as advertising vehicles for their products. In addition, the pressure on top-class athletes to win is so great that they frequently resort to taking stimulants and other illegal drugs to enhance their performance. Another unfortunate result of this domination of sports by big money is that athletes from the poorer countries are seldom represented at the major world competitions.This leads me to the conclusion that we should strongly support the Olympic Games, and make sure that money does not corrupt this international goodwill sports gathering. Everyone agrees that the Olympics are a shining example of how friendly rivalry can dissolve tensions between countries and promote harmony between their peoples. In this regard, it is important that the Games should be distributed more fairly among the countries of the world.",8
Some people propose that smoking should be banned. Do you agree or disagree?,"Smoking is a social problem we are trying to solve. Some people suggest that the government should ban smoking. Indeed, smoking is detrimental to people's health and it violates the rights and freedom of nonsmokers. However, in my opinion, smoking should not be banned for the following reasons.First of all, tobacco is a wonderful commodity to tax. It contributes much to the government's revenue. For example, the government of Britain collects enough from smokers to pay for its entire educational facilities. If smoking is banned, there will be a great drop in the government's income. In addition, more serious social problems will arise, such as unemployment, because tobacco industry employs a lot of workers.Those who strongly approve of the ban lay too much emphasis on the rights of nonsmokers. They ignore smokers' rights. Smoking is just a personal hobby and amusement. It is a kind of lifestyle. It is a stress reliever and can bring great pleasure to smokers. On the contrary, for smokers, nothing seems more difficult and painful than giving up the habit.We must admit that smoking is harmful to people's health. However, the harm that smoking brings to people's health is exaggerated. As long as we smoke in moderation, it will not cause great harm to our body. Take Mr. Churchill as an example. He both smoked and enjoyed a long life.To sum up, I do not think that smoking should be banned. The tobacco industry makes a large contribution to the government's economy. Smoking also brings smokers many psychological benefits. Moreover, there is no evidence showing the direct link between smoking and any fatal diseases.",8
Some businesses now say that no one can smoke cigarettes in any of their offices. Some governments have banned smoking in all public paces. This is a good idea but it also takes away some of our freedom. Do you agree or disagree?,"Currently, many governments have taken the lead in campaigns to eliminate smoking by banning smoking in public places, including restaurants, buses and trains. Now, an ever-growing number of private businesses are issuing regulations forbidding smoking by their employees in their offices. However, some sections of the populace say that, although they approve of the antismoking drive, the banning of smoking in offices is an attack on their freedom.It must be borne in mind that smoking is a health hazard which affects not only the smoker himself, but also all the people around them. In fact, doctors tell us that almost as many people contract diseases—even fatal ones—from breathing second-hand"" smoke, as smokers do.I am sure that I am not alone in stating that the hallmark of a civilized society is the willingness of citizens to give up some of their freedom for the common good. We all give up our freedom to walk in the roads which vehicles use, and the freedom to make loud noises at midnight which might disturb our neighbors. How much more sensible it is to give up the freedom of polluting the air that we must all breathe!The critics may be right, but is it necessarily a bad thing to surrender some of our freedom in this case? To my mind, the ban on smoking must be made as total as possible to have a positive impact on the health of the general public. Therefore, although the critics of the office smoking ban may be right logically, they are certainly wrong morally.""",8
"Some people say the government should not put money in the arts, such as music, opera and paintings, but instead should spend more money on construction of infrastructure. Discuss.","Nowadays, the government is planning to allocate more funds on the construction of artistic projects such as museums, art galleries and parks. However, critics complain that this money should be spent more wisely, say, for building up basic infrastructure. This has aroused a heated debate among the citizens.Some people contend that artistic and cultural projects will surely bring many advantages to the whole society. First of all, the projects can help people to cultivate a better taste for arts and enhance the sensitivity to beauty, thus enriching their spiritual life and upgrading their quality. A man does not live only by bread. Furthermore, these artistic projects are certainly not a money waster. They are potentially profitable. A beautiful city will attract more tourists, thereby boosting its economy. And the money so earned can be further used for the improvement of our standard of living, as well as for the construction of basic infrastructure.However, views on this issue vary from person to person. Some people hold that priority should be given to basic infrastructure. Nowadays many countries are still struggling to achieve modernization and many people are still living below the poverty line. It is without saying that it is difficult to enjoy cultural and leisure pursuits if one's physical needs are not satisfied. So, surely no one would disagree that it is unreasonable to spend government revenue on cultural projects while millions of people still do not have enough food and clothing.Personally I agree that more money should be spent on artistic and cultural projects. They contribute substantially to the landscaping of cities. It is shortsighted not to build them in our cities in the interest of saving money. They make good business sense.",8
"Some people said the government should not put money on building theatres and sports stadiums, and they should spend more money on medical care and education. Do you agree or disagree?","Some people are of the opinion that with the limited budget the government should invest money in medical care and education. As I see it, theatres and sports stadiums are as important as, if not more important than medical care and education. So I believe that it is sagacious to spend money on the construction of theatres and sports stadiums.Theatres can also play an important role in education. There are various forms of education and according to a survey people especially young children are more likely to receive education in the form of amusement. By watching plays, they are able to gradually learn how to adapt themselves to the society and how to communicate with others.Investment in sports stadiums is an active measure to improve people's health. If people's health is improved, we need not spend too much money on medical care and the money to be saved each year can be considerably great, considering the large number of people. So investing money in sports stadiums can save a lot of money in the long run.Theatres and sports stadiums have other practical uses. By watching plays in theatres, people can cultivate a better taste for arts and enhance the sensitivity to beauty, thus enriching their spiritual life and upgrading their quality. Do remember that a man does not live only by bread. Theatres also provide a kind of place of entertainment and recreation for common people to spend their leisure hours. Through sports activities, people can benefit both physically and mentally.Of course, medical care and education are also essential. However, with our current limited budget, I prefer the choice of investment in theatres and sports stadiums.",7
"Science and technology develops very fast in the current society. Some people think that the government should give financial support to the students who study science and technology; some others think the government should support the students who study arts, language and business. What's your opinion?","Our society owes a lot to the development of science and technology. The invention of automobiles shortens the distance of people's travel; the invention of airplanes makes the world become smaller; the invention of computers makes our work and study more efficient. All these should attribute to modern science and technology. But should the government only support the students in science financially and abandon the investment in study and research of other fields like arts, business administration and other humanity subjects? Personally, I don't agree to this opinion.Firstly, the development of arts and other humanity subjects helps us understand our society and gives people spiritual enjoyment. For example, philosophy helps us know our world and think in right ways; arts cultivate people's aesthetic talents and abilities and help people understand what is beautiful and what is ugly; literature gives people joys and sorrows, rendering people abundant imagination.Secondly, the development of arts and humanity subjects can help the development of science and technology. Facts prove that many scientists are also great artists. For example, Albert Einstein, the greatest scientist in the scientific history, was also a very good and professional violinist. Arts can help to cultivate people's thinking and imagination. That's the reason why the students in middle schools and universities are encouraged to develop artistic and literary interest.Thirdly, if the government only gives financial support to the students in science and technology, the students will look down upon arts and humanity subjects and choose to study science and technology. Then, no one will be interested in arts.To sum up, science and arts are complementary to each other. The government should put emphasis on both and encourage the students to choose what they like as their subject.",8
"Some people say that the government should pay for the health care and education of its citizens, but other people say that it is not the government's responsibility. What is your opinion?","There has long been a heated discussion about whether the government should shoulder the responsibilities for its people's basic expenses such as health care and education. Some people argue that yes, it's the government's unshakeable duty to do so. Others, by contrast, hold the opposite opinion. Personally, I choose to stand on the former side.To commence with, let's make clear what the government"" means. It is an institution representing its people's interest and benefits. A democratic government is, in Jefferson's words, ""of the people, for the people and by the people"". Apparently, health care and education both fall into the ring of people's fundamental interest, benefits and rights, thus for sure making a part of the unshakable duties of any government.Furthermore, to guarantee these two benefits is actually crucial to every nation's stability. This is because they are both long-lasting and are extremely costly. If one has to afford them independently, he or she will be forced to do a lot of savings, and will thus live in anxiety for a lengthy period until the day when bank saving is considered ""secure"", which is very likely to be in one's sixties. Therefore, if without these rudimentary benefits, our society will be running under tremendous pressure and insecurity. How can we expect it to develop smoothly and stably?Admittedly, it is also comprehensible for some people to hold the opposite view. They suppose that too much expenditure on these two fields will slow down a country's advancement and people will enjoy fewer benefits as a further consequence. True as it seems to be, these people still ignore one issue, that is, the existence of the government is to ensure that people live a better life. If some basic investment shrinks, it has undoubtedly to be considered negative regardless of whatever potential benefit it may bring about.All in all, it's the government's due and inescapable responsibility to bear people's health care and education expenses, both currently and in the longer term.""",8
"Some people that think good health is very important to every person, so medical services should not be run by profit-making companies. Do the disadvantages of private health care outweigh the advantages?","As an increasing number of people are aware of the importance of good health, the conflict between the ever-growing demand for high quality medical service and the insufficient public medical facilities has been worsened and this issue has been receiving much more attention than ever before. Most of us may thereby form an unrealistic picture about private health care which has been advocated as the best solution so far. However, I firmly believe the disadvantages of private health care outweigh its advantages.Most private health care centers are profit-oriented and indifferent to others' sufferings. It is universally agreed that the prime goal of a hospital is to save lives and cure those in need.However, most owners of private health care centers, just like shop-owners, just aim at making as much money as possible and this runs against the basic principles of hospitals. Newspapers have reported repeatedly cases of some private hospitals refusing to save the lives of poverty-stricken patients, manifesting that some private health care centers are indeed problematic in nature.Furthermore, contrary to what the general public believe, a large number of private health care centers are not qualified enough to practice medical service. In some private hospitals, though the cost of treatment is higher than that in most public hospitals, patients often cannot receive the service promised in advertisements. What is more terrifying is that some so-called doctors in those hospitals have no work experience at all and even their diplomas are fake ones.Last but not least, the government's administration and supervision over private hospitals are often inadequate. Once obtaining the license, some private hospitals would do anything only if it is profitable. Aggravated by inadequate and inefficient inspections and evaluations from the government, many severe consequences have resulted from time to time.To sum up, though nowadays private health care centers are playing an indispensable role, they are not without their inborn shortcomings. Before those problems mentioned above can be solved, it is still too early to talk about transferring most of the medical service to profit-making hospitals.",8
"A government's role is only to provide defence capability and urban infrastructure (roads, water supplies, etc.). All other services (education, health, social security) should be provided by private groups or individuals in the community. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?","Government can only provide a limited range of services for citizens. Certain types of service, however, must be provided by governments, whereas both governments and private groups or individuals can share the responsibility to provide other services.Government must provide those services which are essential to a country. These include defence capabilities and social security. Private enterprise and the profit motive should not form part of these essential services. On the other hand, some services could be provided by either governments or private groups or both. Education and health care are examples of such services. A government must provide at least a basic level of education and health care so all citizens can have access to them. Private enterprise, though, could also provide services in these areas for those who wish to pay for them.Urban infrastructure is another area where government and private groups or individuals can share responsibility. Governments must build and maintain a system of roads, but toll roads can be built and road maintenance can be carried out by private contractors. Similarly, other infrastructure, such as water or electricity supply, can be operated by private companies.To sum up, there are some services such as defence and social security which must be provided by government. Other services, for example water supply or education, could be provided by both. A government's role is only to provide some services while others should be provided by the private sector. In fact, both government and private groups can share in the provision of most services.",8
"In some countries the average worker is obliged to retire at the age of 60 to 65. Some people agree this practice, while others do not. What do you think?","At what age should seniors withdraw from permanent work? One practice in some countries is to require them by law to retire at the age of 60 to 65. However, such policy will bring about some serious social problems.The first reason against the compulsory practice is that it restricts personal choice. Having pursued a career for years, some older employees regard it as part of their lives, the basis for their happiness. This compulsory policy would make them feel useless and depressed. There would even be a greater likelihood of their suffering from certain mental problems.The social effects of asking some seniors to retire by law are more alarming. One of its negative impacts is a strain on the labour market. Among people nearing retirement ageare some experts in their various fields. With knowledge and experience accumulated over many years, they may indeed be more productive and valuable than young people. In some circumstances, the role they play in their own areas cannot even be replaced, so forcing them to retire means losing a significant part of the organization's labour resource and even leads to labour shortage.Having seniors retire by force not only means stopping them from being productive, but also implies a social welfare cost. The more retirees, the more pensions a government has to pay. This may hinder economic progress, as pensions could cost a significant part of the country's wealth. Worst of all, when the burden becomes too heavy to shoulder, serious social and economic problems will arise. There is no doubt that the burden of social security payments is lower when seniors remain at work.These are only some of the reasons against compulsory retirement. All in all, it is not appropriate for a government to impose compulsory retirement on the aged. What it can do is to suggest an age when old people may choose to retire.",8
Some people say that censorship should be cancelled completely. Do you agree or disagree with the statement? Give your specific reasons for your answer.,"As to whether it is worthwhile for a modern civilized society to retain the practice of censorship, there is a long-running controversial debate. It is quite natural that people from different backgrounds may have divergent attitudes towards it.Some critics insist that we should abolish this practice. They claim that this is a violation of freedom. As society progresses, democracy should develop, too. We should enjoy more freedom than before. We should be allowed to do whatever we like to. And news reporters should have the right to report what they want to cover. All of us have the basic human rights such as freedom of speech and freedom of press. Moreover, the practice may more often than not be abused and applied to all aspects of life. Some artists even say that the practice of censorship will ineluctably interfere with their creation. Therefore, they hold that any efforts to restrict people's freedom of speech and press should be condemned.Inevitably, on the other side, there are others who strongly advocate the practice of censorship. Democracy can not go to extremes. They think that it's essential to exercise this practice because they believe that too much liberty spoils all. They have several reasons for this. Firstly, with this practice, we can guarantee the positive influence of the mass media. We can make sure that what is reported is true and that the effects are good. If people are given the reins to report whatever they like to, there is possibility that some news items are nothing true but sensational in order to grab the public attention and make profits. Secondly, the responsibility of society of mass media is strengthened. They will think over what kind of results their articles will bring about every time they write. And they will aim to collect writing materials which will exert beneficial and positive influence on the public. Thirdly, we can have a clean cultural environment, which is essential and crucial to the smooth and healthy development of our society.With views of both sides considered, I think that it's necessary to exercise the practice of censorship for the good of our society, and for the good of our younger generations.",8
What are the purposes of places such as museums and how should they be funded?,"Over the past several years, through the painstaking joint efforts by the government and citizens, our city has taken on a new look. People praise highly the beautiful environment and cityscape. Currently, the city government is planning to allocate more funds on the construction of museums, with an aim to upgrade the artistic taste of the citizens.Museums can enrich people's cultural life. First, by visiting museums, people can cultivate a better taste for arts and enhance the sensitivity to beauty, thus enriching their spiritual life and upgrading their quality. Second, museums provide a kind of place of entertainment and recreation for common people to spend their leisure hours. Most important of all, they are an essential part of spiritual civilization construction. Do remember that a man does not live only by bread.Museums help boost the local tourism. Most museums are symbols of the city as well as the country, which appeal to visitors from home and abroad. For instance, when foreign friends are visiting Beijing, apart from the Great Wall, they are bound to have a tour in the Forbidden City, the most famous museum in China. Visiting a museum is one of the best ways to learn the local culture and touring through a museum provides visitors with a pleasant experience.Museums also play a vital role in education especially to students and children who will learn a lot of knowledge from them. By visiting the historical museum, they can learn the tradition, history and culture of the country and the world. The natural museum can arouse their interest of science. By visiting it, they can find how interesting the nature is. These activities are much more meaningful and valuable than playing video games.Museums are indispensable for the people as well as the country. Therefore, the whole society should take effective efforts to subsidize the construction of museums. It is the government's duty to invest more money in the building and maintenance of museums. Sometimes the government's budget is limited, so attracting the foreign investment is also a sensible way. The profitable enterprises and wealthy individuals should also give their hands.",7
Should a country invest huge amounts of money on the research of weapons?,"With the development of world peace and the process of globalization, the aspiration for peace becomes very keen. But there are still some countries, which carry out experiments with advanced and mass-destructive weapons. From my point, it is against the trend of our world and people's will.Firstly, the development of weapons can cause instability and chaos of our world. The people who love peace are keeping an eye on the conflicts between India and Pakistan. Many people and soldiers become cannon fodders every day. Many soldiers and civilians are wounded in the battlefields, which is a misery in the current world.Secondly, large amounts of investment on the research of weapons will decelerate the development of other aspects, such as education, economy, industry and infrastructure. The arms race between USA and former USSR is a very vivid illustration. Now, the economy of both countries is seriously affected by the Arms Race, especially the former USSR. Finally, some weapons are mass destructive and catastrophic, one of which is atom bombs. People in Japan still remember the nightmare when two atom bombs exploded over Japan. Many people died and disabled, which is a tragedy of our world. Of course, it is understandable and reasonable for a country to keep some weapons for the purpose of self-defense rather than invasion.We are in favor of peaceful solutions to the disputes between countries, because every country enjoys independent sovereignty and equal rights with others. Any invasion and threats to a country are against the international laws and people's aspiration.",8
"Many people think that countries have a moral obligation to help each other, while others argue that the aid money is misspent by the governments that receive it, so the international aid should not be given to the poor countries in the world. What do you think?","With the process of economic globalization, many countries and regions have strengthened cooperation and liaison in the fields of industry, agriculture, trade and finance. In order to dedicate themselves to the mutual development, many developed countries spare no efforts to help the poor countries by means of technological, medical and financial aid, which, to my mind, is quite essential to the development of the world.Firstly, aids from developed countries optimize people's living standard and eradicate poverty in the poor countries. Due to the backwardness of science and technology, people in some undeveloped countries and regions such as Africa, Latin America and Asia suffer a great deal from poverty, hunger and the scarcity of water. International aids from developed countries have improved their living environment and helped them with the development of agriculture, industry and economy.Secondly, international aids give good medical care and help promote hygienic condition in the poor countries. Malaria, cholera and smallpox were once severe threats to people's health. With the help of the World Health Organization and some developed countries, these diseases have been eliminated soon and the residents in the infected areas survived these deadly diseases, which would have devoured millions of lives without international aid.Finally, aids to the undeveloped countries in turn benefit the donators. Due to the limitation of natural and human resources, the production cost rises sharply in the developed countries. With a view to reducing cost, many countries transferred their assembly lines and production bases to the developing countries, which not only solves the problem of low rate of employment in the developing countries but also make full use of the local resources.Nevertheless, some countries are showing great concern about the mal-expense of their aid aroused by bureaucracy and corruption of some governments. Therefore, the governments should take effective measures to utilize international aids reasonably and prevent abuse. Only with the help of international aids, can our world develop more quickly and prosperously.",8
Housing shortage in big cities can cause severe consequences. Only government action can solve this problem. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"There is no denying that housing shortage in metropolitan cities has already become an extremely serious problem over the last decades. The severe consequences caused by housing shortage have also become an issue that has drawn wide public concerns. Some people claim that proper actions should be taken by the government without any delay in view of the severity of the problem, but others are in high favor that, in addition to the government, both individuals and big enterprises should also take on the responsibilities to deal with this problem. Thus, a controversial discussion has arisen on this issue.People who side with the former opinion point out that only the government has the obligation and ability to make out policies to standardize the behaviors in house construction and purchasing. In addition, only the government can provide sufficient fund and necessary facilities in the process of problem solving.People who agree with the latter viewpoint believe that joint efforts from both the government and big enterprises are needed to better solve this problem. For one thing, big enterprises, especially real estate companies, have more professional insights into this issue. For another, it is impossible for the government to focus only on solving housing problems because it has a lot more issues to address. Besides, housing problem is closely related to the overpopulation in big cities and the problem of overpopulation can not be solved in the short term.Based on the foregoing discussion, I would argue that the government, enterprises and individuals should join their efforts in order to effectively cope with this problem.",8
People believe that they should be able to keep all the money they earn and should not pay tax to the state. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"To work and get paid is a well accepted social practice, but to pay part of salary to the government as tax has been challenged by quite a few opponents who believe that their salary is their own money and nobody can take it away without their consent. In my opinion, people should pay tax to the state for the following three reasons.The first reason is that people get paid in different ways. For those industrial workers, the salary comes from part of the profits they create themselves. But for those who do not manufacture products, policemen for example, there is no direct profit from their work. Therefore, part of the profit made by industrial workers need to go to this latter group of people, whose work is equally important to the entire society.The second reason is that the tax paid to the state is partly used to build and maintain public works which in return benefit the people themselves. The convenient transportation network like airlines or railways has made the world smaller and travel over long distance has become a commonplace experience. if Without the contribution of taxpayers, there would be no such kind of things to speak of.The last reason is that poor people can be helped by the tax paid to the government. For various reasons, some people are not as fortunate as others in finding a job or even shelter to keep themselves from starvation, diseases and even death. At his time, the tax money works. It offers these people the most basic foods and clothes to survive the difficulty and enjoy their right to live as a human at the least.All in all, taxation is an important way of redistributing the GDP. It is beneficial not only to the whole country and society, but also to every individual.",8
Many developing countries are currently expanding their tourist industries. Why is the case? Is it a positive development?,"Currently, there is a hot discussion about the reasons why there are developing countries in growing numbers expanding tourist industries and whether it is a positive development or not. As far as I am concerned, I am convinced that it is a positive development. In this essay, I will make an analysis of the reasons in the following paragraphs.The first and foremost reason is that, tourism, which becomes the principal source of financial revenue in many developing countries, is financially beneficial to the economic development. For instance, China needs an increasing amount of foreign currencies for its modernization drive. Tourism is one of the most crucial channels to obtain such currencies. Furthermore, tourism facilitates the development of the catering business and transportation service as well. Additionally, tourist industries make primary contribution to the national income and tax revenue.In the second place, tourism provides local habitants in tourist attractions with more opportunities of employment, which has eliminated some social problems to some extent. In the scenic spots, it is common that even the uneducated people can make a living simply by selling souvenirs, local specialties and so on, which relieves the pressure of the local government.Last but not least, it is true that tourism contributes a great deal to the friendship and mutual understanding between people from different countries, which will unquestionably enhance the future cooperation in international affairs. Tourism provides people with a good opportunity to have a better understanding of the culture, history and customs in foreign countries.All in all, it is of great benefit for developing countries to promote the tourist industry, for it will play a positive role in both the economic and political development of a country.",8
"Tourism is a multibillion-dollar industry that supports economic development. However, some people think that it causes too much damage to the local environment and culture. What do you think?","Tourism, as a multibillion-dollar business, is booming everywhere. Some people, laboring under the belief that tourism serves as an engine of economic growth, seem to ignore its negative effects on the environment and culture. But I think that these are not concerns that we can shrug off lightly.Over the past century, with the development of new transportation means, travel has become easier than ever. Many popular places are flooded with visitors, who spoil the beauty of nature by creating and leaving behind God-knows-how-much trash. In addition, a lot of unsightly artificial facilities have been and continue to be built in order to promote tourism, with disastrous effects on the environment.Another drawback of tourism is the conducted tour, which greatly restricts the exposure of tourists to local culture, and contributes little to mutual understanding between nations and cultures. On the contrary, the superficial impressions tourists get during such tours only intensify their stereotyped ideas about other cultures. On the other hand, the foreign ways introduced by travelers may well have an adverse impact on the local people, who tend to be susceptible to the influence of more advanced cultures. In the long run, the uniqueness of individual cultures will be wiped out by such homogenization.But don't get me wrong. I am not saying that the tourism industry shall be banned in any country, as it does help to shore up the economy in places which offer few sources of income. The significant point is that the unchecked growth of the travel business may render the development of an economy unsustainable. So steps have to be taken to prevent the local culture from being contaminated"" or even engulfed by other cultures. It is high time that we did something to rectify this by taking the environment and cultural protection into account.",8
The lottery does more good than harm. Discuss.,"For better or worse, the lottery has become a part of our life. There are, it is true, people who worry about the negative effects the lottery may have, but I believe it does more good than harm.First of all, the lottery is an effective way of raising money for welfare programs and other public projects. Although taxes have traditionally been the main source for such undertakings, people pay taxes grudgingly, and increasing taxes is time-consuming and may result in increasing popular discontent. However, people eagerly buy lottery tickets, and so, so long as it is well regulated, the lottery can serve as an important source of state revenue.For average people, especially those who have no salable skills, the lottery might be the only opportunity for them to get rich-even to become a millionaire overnight. For instance, a friend of mine has been in financial trouble for many years. The other day, he hit thejackpot by selecting the winning number in the lottery. Now he is the richest guy in our community, and is leading a life he never even dreamed of before.With some people, their enthusiasm for the lottery is not about money but about fun. They don't care about winning or losing; they just like to choose numbers and watch the results. They enjoy the excitement of analyzing the possibilities. For them, buying lottery tickets is just one of their hobbies.Some people are concerned that the lottery may encourage laziness and gambling. But evidence from the countries where public lotteries are legal does not justify this worry. In fact, in China the lottery has turned out not to be a monster but something beneficial. In conclusion, experience has shown that the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages.",8
Many females join the army in some countries. Some people think women should not join the army. Do you agree or disagree?,"This is a world of gender equality, or, at least, a world calling for so. Many people are confident that we should not allow women to join the army as soldiers. On the other hand, other people stand on a very different ground. They advocate that women should be entitled to joining the army.Some arguments can be made that women should be allowed to serve as soldiers in army. In the first place, it is the rights and obligations for every citizen to defend his motherland. We cannot deprive women of such rights. In the second place, allowing women in the army is beneficial to soldiers' psychological health. As this society is made up of males and females, the environment consisting only of members of the same sex will definitely lead to mental problems. Finally, the war in modern times uses largely hi-tech weapons. In other words, although women are physically weak, they can still become qualified soldiers.However, further analysis would make it clear that women should not join the army. To begin with, female soldiers would reduce the efficiency of military operations. They are more likely to get wounded. As a result, it can, when real battle occurs, put the whole troop in danger. Moreover, women's joining the army would inevitably boost the military budget. The uniforms and weapons such as tanks or helicopters have to be redesigned for the convenience of women soldiers, which takes a good sum of money. Last but not least, female soldiers' stay in the army is shorter than the male soldiers, as they have anotherprofession waiting for them: mother. Consequently, the country, in the light of training cost, incurs losses.In summary, I do not think it a good idea to have females in the army. Females are physically weaker than males and therefore it is difficult for women to be soldiers. In addition, the government would have to invest more money on military facilities for the sake of women soldiers.",7
The university should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. Do you agree or disagree?,"Whether the university should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject is a commonly discussed topic and still in debate. Some people claim that it should be the policy; otherwise it will raise a discrimination based on gender. But from thepoint of my view, the ratio of man and woman students in college ought to be different depending on different areas.First of all, let us talk about the so-called first nature. In general, boys love machines much more than girls do from their early childhood. Boys like playing with cars and games, while girls love Babe Dolls and decorating their bedrooms. It can certainly be expected that more boys are interested in engineering, and more girls intend to choose literature or education when they grow up.Secondly, psychologically speaking, men are more logical and women are more sensitive and careful. That is why you see dominant party of girls in nursing school. At the same time, dealing with mathematics is a piece of cake to boys but a big disaster to most of girls. To choose a subject depends on the individual's personality, so it will be unreasonable for the university to take equal numbers of males and females in every subject.At last, in today's society, there are still different social responsibilities to males and females. Even though in more and more fields, for example, biological research or computer science, you can see no big difference between the two genders and boys or girls are doing equally well, there are certain areas preferring one gender but not the other one. We are all used to meeting a sweet nurse in white at hospital but may feel weird to see a big guy injecting flu shot to you.From discussed above, we can easily see the truth that males and females have physiological differences and are interested in different fields. So I can not see a convincing reason to urge the university to accept equal numbers on male and female.""",8
Should children be educated in single-sex schools? What is your opinion?,"Which form of education is more desirable for children—co-education, where boys and girls attend school together, or single-sex schools? To answer this, one should first think about the aim of education at school. Cramming children's heads full of knowledge is by no means the main purpose. The more important goal is to prepare them to take their place in adult society. As this society is made up of males and females, a segregated school consisting only of members of the same sex cannot serve this purpose well.By contrast, a co-educational school is far preferable in achieving this aim, offering students nothing less than a true version of society in miniature. Boys and girls are given the opportunity to get to know each other, and to learn to live together from their earliest years. They are in a position to compare themselves with each other in terms of academic ability, athletic achievement and many of the extra-curricular activities which are part of school life. In this way, boys don't grow up imagining that women are mysterious creatures and girls don't grow up scared of men. Years of associating with each other at school dispel illusions of this kind.Those against co-education hold that the environment will probably lead children to puppy love which will then serve as an obstacle to their academic achievement. They believe segregated schools will prevent such things from happening. In fact, it is likely to make matter worse. Love is a normal physical and emotional need in the process of one's growing-up. Such a desire can not be effectively suppressed. As a matter of fact, when you try to suppress it by separating boys from girls, you achieve the exact opposite. Alternatively, members of the same sex spend all their time together as they will seek to satisfy their need for intimacy. As a result, segregated schools may breed sexual deviation.In co-educational schools, it cannot be denied that the flower of love between boys and girlsmay blossom too early. But this is not necessarily as harmful as many educators may think. What we need to do is to teach them how to deal with problems about love when they occur.In conclusion, co-educational schools, rather than segregated schools offer the proper place for children to become well-adjusted citizens in society.",8
"Throughout the history, male leaders often made society more violent and conflicting. If women governed the world, it would be a more peaceful world? To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Sometimes while looking back on the way we have come along, one may find that seemingly the road is always bumpy and muddy and sadly, the driver happens to be a man most of the time. Some people may thereby form a misunderstanding that it is the male driver who has made the voyage uncomfortable and full of suffering. It is the same case when it comes to history. I firmly believe that whether society is more violent and conflicting does not have a close relationship with the gender of the leader.Throughout the history, it is indisputable that the number of male leaders far surpasses that of female ones. However, this can't serve as the prerequisite of the saying that it is the existence of male leader who created more violence and conflicts in society. On the one hand, most of the time, when male leaders were in power, society remained peaceful and the time of peace was much longer than that of war. On the other hand, it is unreasonable and unacceptable to blame everything on male leaders.Even if the world had been dominated mostly by female leaders, nobody could be sure that the world would have been more peaceful. One could never reverse the wheels of the history and assume that everything could have been changed for the better. In fact, it could have been worse. Therefore, to make such an assumption is groundless and valueless. Furthermore, not all women are peaceful and graceful. There were in world history quite a few women who were aggressive and impetuous, especially when they came into power.To summarize, male leaders don't prevail over female ones when it comes to governing society and vice versa. No matter who seizes the throne, the orbit of society would never be changed. To exaggerate the function of the gender of the leader does not hold any water.",8
Most high level jobs are done by men. Should the government encourage a certain percentage of these jobs to be reserved for women?,"Now, most of the jobs in society that are high-paying, powerful, and demand a lot of responsibility are held by men. I think the government should reserve a percentage of these jobs for females.Firstly, the problem of unfair employment distribution comes from social convention. At a young age most girls are not encouraged to pursue political office, business success, or professional prestige. On the other hand, boys are told to do these things. As a result, men hold the high level jobs but this does not mean they are very good at what they do. If the government set a quota for hiring women to do high level work, such as working in the government itself, then perhaps women would be more inspired to be ambitious in their life plans.Furthermore, to legislate a percentage of high level jobs for women would work to fight the unwritten sexist rules of the workplace. For instance, if a man and a woman both compete for a managerial position of a company, and both are equally qualified and have the same experience and background, there is little doubt who would get the job. Even more, if the man is less qualified and less experienced than the woman, the man would still probably get the job because of his sex. Therefore, the government should reserve a certain percentage of high level jobs to ensure that some highly trained women could be hired.On the other hand, there are many arguments against the use of a quota system for women. It is true that the injustice and discrimination could be reversed. This is to say that some qualified men might be denied a job while some unqualified women would be given one. Nevertheless, a quota system would break down some barriers between the men and the women. With the help of this practice, the sexism in the workplace will disappear gradually.To sum up, from what I have mentioned above, it is not difficult to get to the conclusion that the government should reserve a percentage of these jobs for females.",7
"Some people feel that entertainment workers (e.g. film stars, pop musicians or sports stars) are paid too much money. Do you agree or disagree? Which other types should be highly paid?","I agree with the view that stars in the entertainment business are usually overpaid. This is true whether we are considering stars of films, sports or popular music, and it often seems that the amount of money they are able to earn in a short time cannot possibly be justified by the amount of work they do.However, it is also true that it is only those who reach the very top of their profession who can get these huge salaries. So the size of salary that stars expect is closely linked to the competition they have to overcome in order to reach success.Furthermore, the majority of stars do not hold their top positions long. Sport stars and pop stars , for example, are soon replaced by the next younger, more energetic, generation, while the good looks of most films stars quickly fade. So this relatively short working life may be some justification for the very high pay.Unfortunately, professionals from the other fields, who make a much greater contribution to human society, are paid so much less that it is hard to disagree with the statement. Teachers, nurses, laboratory researchers etc. are never listed among the best-paid professionals, yet, they are more important to our well-being and our future than the stars who earn their fortune so quickly.In conclusion, I think there may be some reasons why entertainment stars earn high salaries but overall I agree that they are overpaid. The gaps between their earnings and those of people who work less selfishly for the good of society cannot be justified. Such professionals should be much better appreciated and better paid.",7
"In some countries, sports and entertainment personalities earn higher salaries than professionals like doctors, nurses and teachers. Why do you think this happens in some societies and do you consider it is good or bad?","Nowadays, sports and entertainment personalities have increasingly higher value than professional workers. As society progresses, consumers will place higher value on leisure and fitness, and they spend more money on entertainment and sports, which is the major reason for those people to enjoy higher salary and more popularity. In addition, the media and advertising industry give them great publicity to bring them even higher value. However, in my opinion, the escalation of the high value on sports and entertainment personalities is not a good development.Some professional workers actually create more value than the sports and entertaining personalities. The teachers will educate many individuals; perhaps through their influence, some students may change the destiny of mankind. The doctors will save the lives of hundreds of people. A physicist will gain a better understanding of the nature of reality, and perhaps contributes to the advancement of technology in order to make life better for all the humanity. However, those professional workers might receive only 1/10, or 1/100 of the money that sports or entertaining personalities obtained and they attract only slight attention from people.If professional workers achieve higher value than sports and entertaining personalities, it will motivate young people into making science a career choice and drive human knowledge to new heights. Sports and entertaining programs, on the other hand, are quite inadequate for people who want to meditate and look for deeper meanings of life.The destiny of our children and ourselves is a concern that requires foresight. There is something lacking in our culture. It is time that we value more of the professional workers for the well-being of the society.",7
Successful sports professionals can earn a great deal more money than people in other important professions. Some people think this is fully justified while others think it is unfair. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"As a result of constant media attention, sports professionals in my country have become stars and celebrities, and those at the top are paid huge salaries. Just like movie stars, they live extravagant lifestyles with huge houses and cars.Many people find their rewards unfair, especially when comparing these super salaries with those of top surgeons or research scientists, or even leading politicians who have the responsibility of governing the country. However, sports stars' salaries are not determined by considering the contribution to society a person makes, or the level of responsibility he or she holds. Instead, they reflect the public popularity of sport in general and the level of public support that successful stars can generate. So the notion of fairness"" is not the issue.Those who feel that sports stars' salaries are justified might argue that the number of professionals with real talent is very small, and the money is a recognition of the skills and dedication a person needs to be successful. Competition is constant and a player is tested every time they perform in their relatively short career. The pressure from the media is intense and there is little privacy out of the spotlight. So all of these factors may justify the huge earnings.Personally, I think that the amount of money such sports stars make is more justified than the huge earnings of movie stars, but at the same time, it indicates that our society places more value on sport than on more essential professions and achievements.""",8
"When famous people such as actors, athletes and rock stars give their opinions, many people listen. Do you think we should pay attention to these opinions?","Famous people, such as athletes, actors, and other entertainers, are often interviewed by the press. They not only answer questions about their careers and personal lives, but also often give their opinions on issues of the day. The public tend to give more consideration to the views of the famous than it does to the opinions of more ordinary people. Should we give greater weight to these opinions? In my opinion, we should not, for the following reasons.First, famous people are not necessarily well informed about the issues under discussion. While everyone has a right to express his opinion, a willingness to speak does not imply knowledge. Furthermore, a famous person may be an authority in his field, but that does not mean he is also an expert in others. For example, an actor who plays a doctor on TV is probably not a true authority on medical matters.Second, a famous person may not be impartial. Rather, he may have financial or other motives for the opinions he espouses. This is particularly true when some type of product endorsement is involved. A good example of this would be an entertainer who proclaims the benefits of a certain product when he has, in fact, never even tried it.Third, a reliance on the opinions of famous people may prevent us from thinking for ourselves. We should all develop the ability to evaluate facts and reach our own conclusions. While there is no harm in listening to the opinions of others, we must realize that our situations are often very different. What may be true or beneficial for one person, may not be so for another. This is especially true in the case of famous people who, due to their wealth and fame, live in circumstances that are very different from those of ordinary people.To sum up, we would be better off learning to evaluate situations and reach our own conclusions than relying on the opinions of others, no matter how well-known. Listening to the views of other people is a good way to gather information and come to our own decisions. However, we should not accept the opinions of others blindly. Instead, we must consider their knowledge and motivation. Famous people have the power to draw attention to a certain message that might not otherwise be heard, but we must still determine the validity of the message for ourselves.",8
The length of the holiday that an employee receives per-year varies from job to job. Do you think people should have the same amount of holidays regardless of their occupations? Give reasons for your answer.,"Nowadays, people are enjoying more and longer holidays and some people advocate that people should have the same length of holiday regardless of their occupations. They hold that it is unfair for people not to rest for the same length of time even though they have worked as hard. They even regard this as a human rights issue, just like women's right to vote. But taking into account the characteristics of different professions, we may examine this issue from another angle.As we know, jobs vary from one another in their labor intensity, so that people in different occupations may have a different kind and amount of leisure time to refresh themselves. For example, blue-collar workers may work longer hours and physically tired, while white-collar workers such as doctors and teachers are more mentally stressed. Therefore they can not work continuously as long as those physical labor workers. Generally speaking, it needs more time to pull through the mental weariness than physical tiredness.Secondly, different tasks and duties are required for different professions, which results in the varieties of holiday periods for people in different walks of life. Some employees cannot have their legal holidays and even have to work overtime, such as policemen, construction workers and people in the service line. This kind of professions just can't be interrupted for a moment; otherwise the society will be in a mess. Even for some people in the same occupations, they can not have the same holidays entitled to them due to many factors out of human control, such as special assignments, and health conditions etc, then not to say people in different fields.Thirdly, with the development of science and technology, the ways people work are gradually changing. Computer experts make their programs, doctors give patients diagnosis and tutors give students instructions at home through optical-fabric cable connections, which saves them much time. Consequently, it may be quite natural for these people to have more leisure than their colleagues who still have to take buses to go to work. In another word, the way people work is not fixed so that they need different holiday phases.All the above suggest that we can not come to the simple conclusion that the different length of holiday time indicates unfairness. We may discover that is it neither possible nor reasonable to apply this belief to practice.",8
"A great number of people think that those with university education should get higher pay than those without, for they believe that the former have sweated and sacrificed more. To what extent do you agree with this point of view?","Many people believe that those who have received higher education should earn far more than those who have not, because the former have exerted more efforts than the latter. Personally I do not agree with this opinion, for the following reasons.In the first place, one's individual income does not wholly reflect the extent to which one's self-value and social value are realized. A person who has received higher education may offer more social value than one who has not. Economists and merchants may serve as perfect examples to verify this point. Both are engaged in the economic sphere.Nevertheless, the former might create more economic returns for society, while the latter might bring himself more economic profits. Although the economist may not be as wealthy as the merchant, his work is more meaningful to the society he lives in.In the second place, some people who have admirable capabilities have not had the opportunity to receive higher education. Then, after years of exertions and hard struggle, they secure a proper place for themselves in society and realize their own self-value. Such people have received no college education. However, they deserve what they have earned.All in all, it is ridiculous to rack one's brains about who, a man with a higher education or another one without it, should earn more money than the other. One's earnings cannot be solely determined by his or her educational background. We should observe what kind of effort a person has made and decide how we are to define personal income"" before finally judging who should earn more.""",8
Some people hold that criminals should be sent to prison. Some others think they should do something else outside prison as the punishment. What is your opinion?,"In recent years, the record of crime rate has been constantly renewed. A growing number of people have begun to challenge against the existing practice of sending criminals to prison. They argue that the law offenders should be punished to do something for the public. It is quite natural that people seldom reach a total agreement on such a controversial issue.Some people advocate that we should let criminals do something else as punishment. In the first place, they can get better reclamation in this way. Doing something for society is a good measure, which not only punishes the criminals but also encourages them to begin a new life as well. Another reason is due to the limited jail space. Letting criminals do something outside jails decreases the cost of the government. Finally, the imprisonment of criminals cannot scare off the criminals. Up to now, there is no evidence showing the direct link between the implementation of imprisoning criminals and the decline of crime rate.Some others approve of the imprisonment of criminals. First of all, it can ensure a safe living environment to the law-abiding citizens. For criminals like thieves, robbers, rapists or even murderers, it is improper or even dangerous to let them out of jails, because they still pose threats to our society. Second, it is the best deterrent to those potential criminals. It will make would-be criminals think twice before they commit a crime. Last but not least, itis a great spiritual consolation to the victims. Those who suggest setting criminals free lay too much emphasis on the rights of criminals. They ignore the rights of victims.All the above opinions make sense. After careful consideration, I am in favor of the latter view that we should retain the practice of sending criminals to prison. It can guarantee the safety of citizens. It can reduce the crime rate. Furthermore, it serves a punishment for the merciless offenders while a comfort to the innocent victims.",7
Some people prefer to live in the countryside. Others prefer to live in a big city. What is your opinion?,"An increasing number of people are pouring into the city and looking for a nest there. Some people hold the opinion that we should live in the countryside. However, some others strongly argue that city is a better place for us to live in. It is quite natural that people from different backgrounds may have divergent attitudes towards it.Those people who strongly believe that living in a big city has several benefits have cogent reasons for it. To begin with, there are more job opportunities readily available in big cities than in the countryside. Furthermore, not merely there are more job positions in big cities, the pay is more decent. Besides, children are supposed to be able to receive an education with a higher quality compared with their counterparts who live in the countryside. For most families, children's education is always put first. More importantly, shopping, a necessary activity in everyday life is more convenient in the city than in the country. Urban citizens can buy what they want at any time of a day.However, there are a large number of people who hold a different view concerning this case. They believe that living in the countryside also has some advantages. First of all, people who live in the countryside often have a much comfortable lifestyle. Most of them are immune from the suffering of high work stress. In addition, although the average pay is much less than that of big cities, the price of daily necessities, such as vegetables or meat, is usually more inexpensive. Therefore, the cheap life in the country appeals to many city-dwellers. What is more, instead of suffering loneliness which is prevalent in big cities, children might grow up healthier because of harmonious relationship among residents in the countryside. A country allows children to experience a more natural environment without all the distractions of entertainment places in the city.Both sides make sense. Therefore it is really hard for me to draw a definite conclusion. To my mind, the countryside is a better place for people to live in. Country life is featured in the fresh air, the peaceful night, and the friendly people. Wherever the city may be, the life there is much more expensive than in the countryside. Furthermore, without all the dangers and distractions of city life, children will grow up healthier.",7
"When we seek a future career, what factors should we consider? Whose suggestions should we consider?","Choosing the right career is regarded as a turning point in one's life. It is so crucial that we cannot afford to make a single mistake. However, it is always not easy to make a satisfying choice. Sometimes we find ourselves involved in dilemmas. To my mind, when we seek a job, the following factors need to be taken into consideration.The first factor that can be seen by every person is that the salary should not be too low. Most people will be married and have children, so they need a stable income because of their family responsibilities even if they are not satisfied with their job. In addition, to live a more comfortable life is a part of human nature. All these things need a certain amount of money.Another factor that we must consider is that we should have an objective understanding of our ability so that we will know which occupation is suitable for us. In other words, the job should allow us to live a balanced life. It should not be so time-consuming that we have no time for family, friends and personal interests. Nor should it give us so much pressure that we cannot relax in our free time.As the proverb goes, two heads are better than one. When we choose a job, always remember to talk with parents, teachers or anyone we trust. They possess rich experience and knowledge from which we are sure to benefit. They know us best and can offer us most sincere advice. Keep in mind the old saying that it is good to learn at another man's cost. Furthermore, we may also seek advice from the career advisory office that is always ready to provide professional suggestion.",8
"Unlike other countries, the police in the UK do not carry guns. Some think this leaves citizens unprotected, while others consider it reduces the overall level of violence in society. Give reasons for both sides of this argument and state your own opinion.","As opposed to the extensive use of weapons in the US, people in UK, even the police are not allowed to take guns. Some people argue that it may trigger off insecurity of city dwellers, whereas others assert that it can eliminate the whole violence in the society. Hereby, I would like to discuss both perspectives in the following paragraphs.Some people believe that the absence of carrying guns is disadvantageous in many aspects in any nations. It has been a trend that the violence is increasing in various parts of the world. More and more criminals these days carry guns and other dangerous weapons,but our police force only have pepper spray and batons for protection (as well as bullet proof vests). This is not enough, not enough of a deterrent, not enough in today's society. If the police have proper equipment, i.e carrying a gun, they would hopefully not lose their lives and the residents will feel safer and better protected.Others, however, hold the opinion that police should not be allowed to carry guns. There have been plenty of cases that some robbers or thieves who commit crime but do not deserve death were shot down by police. Furthermore, some unqualified and irresponsible policemen may hurt some innocent citizens even to death when they are pursuing some culprits. Additionally, guns of police may often be lost and will touch off an even worse situation. And thus, it will reduce the overall violence in our society by not allowing guns to the police.In conclusion, both opponents and proponents of such a practice have their respective reasons and justifications. However, as a person always expecting a peaceful life, I personally agree with the latter view. If the guns and some of other weapons would be totally restricted in the modern globe, the serious phenomenon of violence and other relevant behaviors would vanish. Hence, it is my sincere wish that governments of other countries would follow the example of UK to avoid the whole violence in the world.",8
Should capital punishment be abolished? What is your opinion?,"In recent years, an increasing number of people have begun to challenge against the existing practice of capital punishment. They argue that in a civilized and enlightened society, such a barbaric and cruel practice should be abolished. But, on the other side, there are also many people who strongly advocate the remaining of capital punishment, saying that the world would be in great chaos and full of blood and violence without death penalty. It is quite natural that people seldom reach a total agreement on such a long-running controversy.Those people who approve of the practice of death penalty hold that it is the best deterrent to crime. It will always remind would-be criminals that crime does not pay so that they will think twice before they commit a crime. The decline of heinous crime has a direct correlation with the implementation of capital punishment. Secondly, it serves a just reward for the heartless and merciless malefactors while a great spiritual comfort to the victim's family. The third merit lies in that it is very economical to end the life of a person guilty of crimes for which even death is an insufficient punishment. The practice helps lessen the prison crowding and thus cuts down on government budget.Towards the same issue, many others who advocate the abolition, however, argue that in a highly modernized world, it is inhuman and barbaric to take away one's life on any pretext. They believe in that life is precious and irreversible and that only God can take away one's life. Moreover, capital punishment can not scare off the criminals. Up to now, there is no evidence showing the direct correlation between the practice and the declining incidence of felony. We should offer the offender a chance to mend his/her way and take over a new life. The criminals can be safely locked up in prisons and receive education through labour.Both sides of the argument have very strong feelings and sound reasons. After a thorough consideration, for my part, I am in favor of the former view that we should retain the time-honored catholicon to ensure a safe and comfortable living environment to all these law-abiding citizens. An old saying best expresses my attitude:Mercy to the criminal may be cruelty to the people.""""",8
The rate of young women crimes is rising in the current society. What are the causes and how to solve it?,"Juvenile delinquency is a very serious problem confronting us in modern society. At the same time, the rate of young women crimes spearheads very fast. Some sociologists and educationists show great concern about this problem. In this essay, I will find out the causes for this issue and explore some possible solutions.First of all, the rapid development of society and the changes of people's value of the world account mainly for the issue. In the old days, women were confined to housework and baby-sitting, which barricaded women's steps. Now, with the eye-catching development of economy, many young women go out to find a job, which renders them more opportunities to contact the outside world. As a consequence, young women are apt to be influenced by the malfeasance in the society.Secondly, the rise of criminal rate attributes to the lack of education of women. The prosperity and luxury in some metropolises are very attractive to some young women. Some of them leave the countryside in the hope that they can make a good fortune in the cities, where they often find themselves disappointed for lack of good education or skills. Therefore, some of them felt despaired and embark on the criminal road.The last factor is the over-description of violence on the media. TV is the most powerful medium, which transforms abundant information around the world. However, some programs are full of violent description, sexual alluring and bloody contents, which are easy to make young women astray.In order to solve the problem, people think up various solutions. From my point of view, I think the following are worth mentioning. On one hand, the government should pay more attention to the problem and issue relevant laws to crack down young women crimes. Meanwhile, we should strengthen education and raise the quality of people, helping them set up a correct outlook of the world. Only when the government and the society join hands in solving the problem, will the rate of young women crimes fall down.",8
Juvenile delinquency is increasingly common. Discuss the reasons and make some suggestions.,"Pistols shooting, gun flashes, people screaming hysterically and running in panic, confusion everywhere. This was not a scene from a Hollywood movie, but a recent shooting incident at an American school. The most appalling thing was that the emotionless and brutal killer was a teenager boy. This is a typical example of the increasingly disturbing panorama of juvenile crimes plaguing our society.In the first place, the juvenile delinquency can be attributable to the rising divorce rate and family violence. It is reported that the juvenile delinquency is proportional to the high divorce rate. In such families, children are usually not properly taken care of, and to make things worse, their psychology may probably be distorted. Also, living in a family full of violence, children take it for granted that violence is the best way to resolve problems and they are likely to adopt the measure of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth"". Thus, it is likely that such children may easily be led astray and even worse, they may embark on the criminal road.What is more, the over-description of violence on the media is another vital cause to be considered. Nowadays, many programs are full of crime, violence, pornography and bloody contents; they are often glorified and polished to attract youngsters' eyes and to be conveniently imitated. Watching too many these programs, children may become isolated, violent and aggressive. Thus, their committing crime seems easy to be understood.Given the seriousness of this problem, we have no alternatives but to adopt some feasible and effective measures. To begin with, relevant laws should be set down and implemented to crack down youth crimes. What is more, the families should be reinforced and proper guidance and support should be given to the youth. Finally, crime, violence, pornography and bloody contents shown in media should be banned and the measures to reduce stress from both education and society should be rendered to youngsters. Only when these measures are taken will the rate of juvenile delinquency fall down.""",8
"Today's youth are experimenting with illegal drugs, and at an increasingly early age. Discuss the causes and some effects of widespread drug use by young people in modern society. Make any recommendations you feel are necessary to help fight youth drug abuse.","Thanks to China's reform and opening-up policy, there has been earth shaking economic and social progress in the past two decades and people's living standard has improved, but at the same time it gives rise to a host of serious social problems like drug abuse, the causes of which may be inner and outer influence.Some people become rich materially but spiritually barren and search for new excitement, and some start with ignorance and curiosity because they think drugs can ease stress and renew energy, which may be considered the inner causes of drug abuse. On the other hand, some young people like to follow the fashions and are easily influenced by their companions and cannot resist the temptation of taking up new things like drugs, and more importantly, they can get drugs through different channels, which may be the outer causes of drug abuse.Today's youth are experimenting with drugs at an increasingly early age, which has been brought to public concern. The widespread drug abuse by young people has far-reaching adverse effects on the drug users, their families and even the society. The drug users themselves suffer from different symptoms and at last easily contract AIDS. Since taking drugs costs a huge sum of money, it brings bankruptcy to many families, and even those millionaires. As a result, many families are broken down.The following suggestions should be taken into consideration when the government is seeking solutions to youth drug abuse. First of all, the government should promote the public awareness of the great harm brought by drugs. We can invite some ex-drug-addicts to show the destructive power of drugs by using their own experience. Secondly, the government should strike hard against drug-trafficking and impose heavier penalty on drug-related crimes and drug smugglers.",8
Should euthanasia be legalized? What is your opinion?,"In the last several decades, advances in medical technology have made it possible for people to enjoy longer life span than in the past. Yet when it comes to the desirability of extending the life of the terminally ill and the legalization of the practice of euthanasia, people from different backgrounds have very different opinions.Some people, including some doctors, claim that the practice of euthanasia has merits. First of all, the quality of life is as important as life itself. It is meaningless to maintain the life of a terminally ill patient, which will only prolong his/her agony and sufferings. Secondly, euthanasia will bring emotional and financial release to the patient, the family and to society, thus saving money, and the unnecessary labour of doctors and nurses. Moreover, it is also a human's basic right to choose when, where, and how to die. In a sense, a mercy killing enables one to die with dignity and peace.However, people rarely reach an absolute consensus on such a controversial issue. The opponents argue that the practice of mercy killing is just another kind of killing and killing is always wrong and a sin. No one is entitled to take away another human beings' life—only God can. Life is precious and we all should respect it. Anyway, life under any circumstances is better than death. Besides there is always the chance that some cure may be discovered for the particular disease.Undeniably, there are good points on both sides of the argument. But after careful consideration of the above reasons, I, personally, stand on the side of the advocates, because I firmly believe that the legalization of euthanasia will not only bring mental and physical release to the terminally ill, but also benefit the family and the whole society. The practice of euthanasia is a symbol of the advancement of civilization.",8
A burglar was shot dead by the owner of the house being broken into. Do you think the owner's action was justified?,"Ever since this incident was reported in the newspapers, there has been much controversy about it. After weighing all the pros and cons, I find that I agree that the owner's action was justified. I support my point of view with three arguments: self-defense, the sanctity of property and the need to deter criminals.First, everyone has the right of self-defense. When a burglar breaks into somebody else's house, he is a potential threat to the lives of the people who live there. Therefore, the house owner has the right to defend himself and his family with any weapon he can lay his hands on. If that weapon happens to be a gun, the burglar only has himself to blame.Second, it is a principle of law that private property is inviolable. A person's home is probably the most precious thing he has, and usually contains most of the things that the house owner considers valuable. He has the right to protect the things he has worked hard to accumulate, especially against a thief.Third, there is far too much crime nowadays, and many people think that the courts are too lenient with burglars when they are caught. By shooting the burglar dead, the house owner did a great service for society. In fact, his action sent a warning to other burglars that if they break into other people's houses, they are risking their lives.All in all, I think that the house owner's action was a good one in three aspects. He benefited himself, by preventing the burglar harming him. He benefited the rule of law by asserting the right of a person to safeguard his own property. And, last but not least, he benefited society by deterring would-be burglars.",8
Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in a big city. Which place would you prefer to live in?,"People seldom agree with each other, even in such trivial issues as preference between big cities and small towns. It's a little bit hasty to say that it is better to live in a big city than to live in a small town, or vice versa.Living in a big city has several benefits. First, there are more job opportunities readily available in big cities than in a small town. Furthermore, the qualities of the position are much higher as well. In addition, the pay is more decent. Second, children are supposed to be able to receive an education with a higher quality compared with their counterparts who live in a small town. Finally, living in a big city has a superior overall living standard to that in a small town. There are more commodities and services in city markets and there are even much more television channels in big cities.However, living in a small town also has some advantages. People who live in a small town often have a much comfortable lifestyle. Most of them are immune from the suffering of high work stress.Although the average pay is much less than that of big cities, the price of daily necessities is usually more inexpensive. Instead of suffering loneliness which is prevalent in big cities, children might grow up more healthy because of harmonious relationship among residents in small town. They might have fewer channels in television, but they have more friends readily available to chat or entertain with.According to my current situation, although I am longing for the cozy atmosphere and relationship among neighbors and friends which almost only exist in small towns, I have chosen to live in one of the biggest cities in my country—Beijing, since I have found a pretty good job here, and decent pay. I think I would prefer living in a small town when I retire one day.",8
"While people flood into big cities to seek jobs and a happy life, there is a tendency for people to move out. What problems do big cities have?","Every year men and women crowed into cities in search of employment, a decent living, and the excitement and stimulation of urban life. According to a research, the population in Shanghai alone has increased 26% in the last three years. With the rise in urban population, many big cities have met problems of their own.One big problem is the ever-increasing pressure produced by over-crowding. As more and more people flood into cities, city services and facilities have been strained to a breaking point. Cities have been exposed not only to the problem of traffic and housing, but to the problem of education, sanitation, employment and so on.A second problem is the physical environment. One is the rise in the concentration of high buildings, stripping people of contact with sun and trees and grass—condemning them to a life among stone and concrete, neon lights and endless flow of traffic. Another is the growing number of cars and buses, whose exhaust sends huge quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, making the air of cities unbreathable.But of all our problems, the most serious and pressing, the one which threatens to paralyze the city is the widespread crime. Bank robberies which were unheard of in the past now occur more frequently. Not a single day passes without the reports of somebody being mugged, being kidnapped or being murdered. Today, even walking in the street in broad daylight will make you nervous, let alone in the late night.All these problems make big cities no longer attractive to people as years before. The tendency to move to the edge of the city, the suburban areas reflects this mentality. Unless there is some improvement, more and more people will seek to live in suburbs.",8
"Nowadays, more and more children are becoming obese. Give possible reasons and suggestions.","As some children in poor countries are vastly underweight as a result of poverty, others elsewhere in the world are suffering from another problem—obesity, as a consequence of improved living conditions. A recent study has shown the latter problem is becoming an epidemic, as the number of obese children in the developed world keeps rising alarmingly. I believe there are several factors responsible for this increase.In some cases, there is a genetic link to obesity. It has been found that the children's weight is related to that of their parents. A child of obese parents is more likely to become overweight, as he may inherit some of genes that control body weight from his mother or father.Are genetic reasons the only explanation? Other factors must also be at work and among them is a poor diet. Being afraid that their children may not get enough to eat and even suffer from poor health, some parents are too permissive, allowing them to eat too much, with as many as five or six meals a day. The increasing popularity of fast-food and sweets make matters even worse.It is not just of a question of what young people eat, but also a matter of lifestyles. TV and the Internet have produced sedentary lifestyle. Children who watch TV passively or who use computers for hours every day simply do not get enough physical exercises. Besides, a growing number of preteenagers have come to rely on public transport or lifts from their parents, rather than walking or using bicycles. Lack of activity gradually contributes to overweight.Obesity may have knock-on effects, especially in the form of such diseases as diabetes and heart problems in children's later lives. Solutions to the problem may vary according to root causes. Those whose obesity is gene-related should consult doctors. For others, a better lifestyle, more exercise and a proper diet consisting of more vegetables and fruit and fewer fatty foods may assist.",8
It is hard for people to agree on the definition of happiness. Why? How do people achieve happiness?,"The responses of people around the world will paint a varied picture, as a result of difference in their living conditions, their sex, as well as different cultural and religious experiences. Ask a beggar what his happiness is, and he may reply A square meal"". However, those who have to attend banquets every day for business may seek more for their happiness. It is very hard to give a definition of happiness that holds true for everyone. Although the definition varies from people to people, the routes to happiness are similar for most of us. Whoever you are, follow the strategies below and you may find happiness within a week.Take care of your health. A good physical condition is the best thing God can give us. Poor health will spoil everything. To achieve good health, you should get enough sleep, take time for fun, exercise, and relax and be free from work stress from time to time.You should count your blessings and find the good in each situation. Focus on the good things in your life and start a gratitude journal if possible. To do this, make a point each day of writing down five things for which you're grateful. You'll be amazed at how happy you are.Give something nice for someone else. Reaching out to other people increases our sense of self-worth, and also brightens someone else's day. Moreover, such actions will be rewarded with others' respect and friendliness. You make someone happy, and at the same time, are made happy.You need to find balance. All too often we involve ourselves disproportionately with the same type of activities throughout a week. Variety will help us find a more balanced outlook on life. If you work alone all day, spend your evening hours on a group activity. If meetings occupy your day, explore your creative side in an activity of solitude such as enjoying light music. The more interests you have, the more colourful your life becomes, and the more balanced it is.If you are now feeling unhappy and seeking help to get out of it, why not try these steps to make your world a better and happier place? You'll win emotionally and professionally.""",8
Some people believe that personal happiness is directly related to economic success. Others believe there are other factors. What do you think?,"The pursuit of happiness has long been the dream of generations of human beings. They have always been puzzled by the essence of happiness. What is happiness? Is it closely related to one's economic success? Will one's financial success lead to happiness directly? Personally, I don't agree that one's economic success is the only prerequisite of one's hap-piness in life.One's materialistic happiness is dependant on one's economic success, though not completely. Without a strong and steady economic background, one could never imagine an easy and simple life, let alone an affluent and luxurious one. If you aren't able to afford a house, a car, or even a book, anybody would be horrified at the mere mention of this kind of life. Definitely, some people will feel happy right away if their basic demands for life are satisfied. However, we have to admit that these people still need to be successful materialistically to some degree.On the other hand, one's success in economy may not necessarily lead to one's spiritual happiness. As we all know, money doesn't get you everything and some even say that money is the root of all evils. One's financial success may be built on the sacrifice of time, health and love, which are the three most essential elements of spiritual happiness. All of us are not new to this picture: a successful businessman tasting loneliness alone with a broken heart.In my point of view, one's economic success is only one of the key factors of happiness, but never the only one. To be happy, one needs to be both spiritually and materially satisfied though each of us may have a totally different picture of happiness.",8
Should people always tell the truth? Give your opinion and reasons to support it.,"Honesty has always been considered to be a worthy character trait in whatever culture. Indeed, it is often thought of as the most important human value. Generally speaking, it is therefore not a good idea to tell lies. However, there may be some circumstances when telling lies might be necessary and could even be justified.Providing one makes sure the lie is for the benefits of others, not one's own, it can perhaps be justified. For example, doctors may lie to benefit their patients when they wish to speed recovery or to conceal the approach of death. The requirement of honesty also seems dwarfed when there is a greater need to shelter aging parents from heart-attack in the case of the brutal news that their son has died accidentally. To put his wife at ease and to guarantee a promise of top secrecy, a husband may claim that a life-threatening assignment is just a business trip. All these are benevolent deceptions and are understandable.When you make deceptions with good intention, there is one more thing you have to be sure about—that you do it well. Lying is a great art, and you need to be very careful about it, until practice and life experience give you the confidence, elegance and precision to do it gracefully and beneficially. If you don't, you are almost certainly going to get caught. Once caught, you can never again be, in the eyes of the good and the pure, what you were before. Many a young person has ruined his reputation permanently through a single clumsy and ill-told lie, the result of carelessness born of incomplete training.Integrity is desirable, but the opinion that we ought not to lie at all, of course, is putting it rather more strongly than necessary. I maintain that we can practice this art, if it is in others' interest, and if you know how to use it well. Otherwise, you had better be honest rather than risking your integrity and credibility by playing tricks. The more important thing is not to think about teling lies, or slide into those mechanical and untruthful habits of thought.",8
"The expression ""Never, never give up""means to keep trying and never stop working for your goals. Do you agree or disagree with the statement?","Near the end of the Second World War, Churchill delivered his famous and shortest speech:Never, Never Give Up."" People in Britain and other countries, were tremendously encouraged, and finally went through the hardest period in human history.The words represent a strong and positive attitude toward life. Some people are ready to quit when they cannot endure the difficulties, or they cannot find a way to finish the task. Such people usually become upset and lose their self-confidence, although they virtually can do everything well. Most people fail to acquire a second language because they have given up. It might be the easiest task among academic curriculums, because one can be successful only by repetition.Never give up. Such strong belief often gives us a second chance. The fact that we failed somewhere does not mean to fail everywhere. Many successful people did fail before. Yu Minhong, the founder of New Oriental School, was able to study in Peking University only after three attempts to pass the Entrance Examination of Colleges and Universities. After graduation, almost all his classmates went abroad, while he was refused by officials in visa, yet he never gave up, which made his later success inevitable.Psychology teaches us that we do get what we want. First of all, we must make sure that our goals are achievable, and our methods are practical. A superficial claim like""I wanna be a millionaire!""or""inventing a perpetual motion machine""are absolutely meaningless. But it is realistic or meaningful to acquire a second language by careful planning, and relevant persistence. Numerous examples tell us that even if the methods are problematic, many still finally attain great achievements. Therefore, ""Never, never give up""is really something that we should always bear in mind.""",8
There is nothing that young people can teach older people. Do you agree or disagree?,"The older generation today always complains that the youth are unmotivated anddirectionless, that they lack focus and the future is going down because of their behavior. Nonetheless, youth are the product of their upbringing and the representation of their time. Thus what they are and what they know will certainly be different from those of the older generation. Therefore, to say that the youngsters are useless is wrong, as they can also contribute in their own way, and teach the older generation a lesson or two.As we all know, today's technology moves very fast. With our daily responsibilities, it is almost impossible for us to keep up with every new gadget that comes out. With young people, it is different, new things that interest them. Furthermore, being young, they absorb new knowledge like a sponge. Thus, they can help us to get in tune with new technologies. Young kids, for example, can probably teach their grandparents to use the computers, which in turn, will also be good for their relationships.In addition to this, by looking at the young, we can learn about the society better. As I've mentioned earlier, youngsters represent their time, hence, by understanding them, we can understand the needs of the society, as this group of age is the most outspoken. A good example would be the hippie movement in the 60s. The movement displayed their dissatisfaction with the system, and their need for more freedom of expression.As someone once said, Life is a learning experience"". From that, we can deduce that there is no full stop to the process of learning. Instead of being critical and cynical, maybe we can try to understand the youth better by learning from each other. After all, they are the future.""",8
"Some people think that the company should encourage the employees who are in high positions and over 55 years old to retire, in order to give opportunities to new generation. Do you agree or disagree?","Some people are of the opinion that the employees in the high executive positions should be encouraged to retire when they are over 55 years old. They claim that, by doing this, young people will be given more opportunities. Others oppose this kind of mandatory retirement. Both sides seem to have their reasons.Young people are superior to the old in many ways. First, most young people have received formal education in university, where they acquire abundant knowledge and skills. Compared with young people, old people's knowledge is out-dated, which does not fit in the development of the current society. Second, young people are more open-minded than old people who have a tendency of conservation. Young people can adapt themselves to the changeable world more easily. Finally, the young are energetic and vigorous. Old people react more slowly than young people who can always make quick judges and prompt decisions.Some people who examine this issue from another angle hold that although young people have some predominance they still cannot compete with the old people. First, young people lack adequate experience and skills to deal with sophisticated problems. Some young people, who are very radical when faced with trouble, have a lot of things to learn from old people and most high positions require rich experience and academic achievements. Second, age is not always a true indicator of one's capacities and thanks to the improvement in medical science, people enjoy a much longer life expectancy, so we should redefine the term old age"". Finally, it would be more economical for the company to retain the old hands than to spend more time and money training new ones.In my opinion, the company should not force the old people to retire to give way to the young. The practice is unfair to the old, hinders the social development and does harm to the young who gain the high positions easily.""",7
"In many countries, the proportion of older people is steadily increasing. Does this trend have more positive or negative effects on the society?","The world is getting older. You come across old people everywhere-in restaurants, on airplanes, in hospitals and even in Disneyland! Things were quite different 20 years ago, when young people dominated the world. Is this change in demography good or bad for society? I would say it has more negative effects than positive ones.Doubtlessly, older people are much experienced in life, so to society, and particularly to the younger generation, they are a valuable treasure. This is because older people can give us constructive suggestions and can assist us in doing many different things, preventing us from making mistakes. So, seen from this perspective, an increasing proportion of older people in the population are not necessarily something bad.However, I would not be accurate to say that having an older population always benefits us. It also has negative effects on the society. First of all, the aging population is retiring from the working world. That means it does not offer society the labor it needs for its sustained economic growth. Japan has actually been troubled by its aging laborers who are destined to be the pure wealth consumers. Japanese people are even encouraged by their government to give birth to more babies, not for themselves, but for the nation!Secondly, rapid social development calls for more people with creative and innovative minds and generally speaking, these refer to young people. Electric bulbs and computers would never have come about without groups of young people who were not happy with the status quo and were bold enough to challenge established traditions. It is said more than 80% of the great inventions and literary works are created by people under 40 years old.In a word, while older people enlighten us with their rich experience, they use up more than what they produce. At the same time, they are more likely to follow rules docilely. Therefore, the demerits of an aged population far outweigh its merits.",8
Some people say that the best preparation for life is learning to be cooperative. Others take the opposite view and say that learning to be competitive is the best preparation. Tell which one you agree with and explain why.,"Learning to be competitive is clearly the best preparation for life. No one can be trusted. This becomes very clear as one has more experience in the world. Everyone is out to make their own lives better and must do everything they can to succeed. Let me explain.In the first place everyone knows that man is by nature a competitive, aggressive, and selfish animal. Even Darwin, in The Origin of the Species"", makes it very clear that the weak will die, and only the strong will survive. Since this is our fate, the only intelligent thing to do is to be strong, and be a winner.Also, in the business world, everyone knows that the most important order of the day is to beat your competitors. This can only be done by competing by any and all means necessary to win. No one wants to go out of business, so you must compete. Also, you must be better than the other employees you are working with, because in this age of downsizing, you do not want to be fired.Further, in the sports world, the strongest will come out as winners. They become our heroes and they are glorified in every way. In fact, the only way our world rewards people is to give trophies to the winners, not to the losers. Everyone wants glory in life and learning to be competitive is the only path to glory.Therefore, the only way to survive in this world is to be competitive. To learn to cooperate is a ridiculous way to live one's life. In fact, I know that when I wish to beat someone who is weaker willed than I, I will use their foolish cooperative actions against them in the end.Some people think people should learn to compete, but others think that people should be taught to cooperate. What is your opinion?Cooperation and competition are both essential to people. They are equally necessary for a person to achieve success in his or her future life. But if I must choose one, I would say that competition is as important as, if not important than, cooperation.Competition helps enhance individual abilities. Competition makes people creative. Competition is a product of the development of society and it gives people a sense of the pursuit of excellence. This is people's inborn nature. Without competition, people would remain idle and have no ambition. Many people are fond of competition because it enables them to bring their knowledge or skills into full play. If you want to remain competent in the fierce competition, you have to spend much time reading to make yourself qualified for your present job.Competition is the guarantee of enterprises' existence. They have to produce better things. Otherwise, they will have no customers. So in fact they produce better things for their own benefit. At the same time, people's various requirements can be satisfied and our society can develop as well.Society, through competition, has developed a lot. Fair competition promotes progress and renews the looks of our society. Without competition, people would create nothing. They would feel satisfied with their present conditions. With no competition, therefore, there would be no progress.Cooperation is also indispensable for a better life of the people. Cooperation helps bring individual abilities into full play, make up for each other's inadequacy and enhance the overall quality of the parties concerned. But cooperation without competition may bring about a peaceful life to all but destroy individual's initiative and eventually affect social development.""",7
Should children pursue sport for recreation or as a form of competition? Give your opinion and reasons to support your argument.,"Every parent wants their child to have a happy childhood and to grow up as a well-balanced person. To this end, we adults should always present children with a view of a world which is true, good and beautiful. It is therefore easy to answer the question of whether sport for children should be regarded as recreation or as competition. Recreation is clearly the key to future happiness.When children take part in sport games just for fun, they will gain pleasure from them and cultivate good relationships with others and a sense of cooperation. It also allows children to view each other as collaborators, especially when they get in trouble.On the other hand, competition is absolutely destructive for children and the psychological damage cannot be over-estimated. Competitive games by definition must produce a loser and a winner. Defeat will undermine self-esteem and cause self-doubt. For winners, it does not build character: winning produces feelings of pride which are short-lived. The more the young compete, the more they need to compete to feel good about themselves. Once they fail to beat others, they will feel very frustrated.Competitive encounters have an equally toxic effect on children's relationships among children. In a competition, each child inevitably comes to regard others as rivals or as obstacles to his or her own success. It leads children to envy winners and to dismiss losers. Children become suspicious of just about everyone, as nobody would trust a person who may gain from his failure.he problem is competition itself. If we would like our children to enjoy their childhood and make a friendly world for them, a playing field should not be turned into a battlefield.",8
Some people prefer to plan activities for their free time very carefully. Others choose not to make any plans at all for their free time. Compare the benefits for planning free-time activities with the benefits of not making plans. Which do you prefer-planning or not planning for your leisure time?,"In this busy society, our free time is very valuable to us. It is important that we take some time to relax and renew our energy in order to face the challenges ahead of us. Different people like to spend their leisure time in different ways. Some like to plan their activities so that they can make the most of the time available while others prefer not to plan anything. Both schools of thought have their advantages.When people carefully plan their leisure time, they will not waste any time on decision making or last-minute preparations. This saves them time and, therefore, makes them feel that they have more free time to enjoy. Planning ahead also allows people to take advantages of the opportunity to participate in certain restricted activities. For example, by planning ahead, they can buy tickets for a concert or play that may later be sold out. Finally, being better prepared for an activity not only saves time but can make the outing more fun and more meaningful. It is not much fun to make a spontaneous trip to the beach only to find you have left your swimsuit at home.However, unplanned leisure time also has its advantages. With no commitment to take part in a certain activity or meet a friend at a certain hour, the non-planner can take advantage of last minute changes and opportunities. Furthermore, he will not be disappointed about his plans, because he has made none. On the other hand, if someone has looked forward to a baseball game all week, it is very disappointing if it is cancelled due to rain. Last but not least, unplanned leisure time can be more relaxing. During the workweek, we must all be punctual and face deadlines. Some people prefer to make their free time as different from that as possible.Although both planned and unplanned leisure time have their benefits, I still prefer to plan my free time activities. My free time is limited, and so I want to make the best use of it. By planning ahead, I can take part in the activities that I want and spend time with the people I want to see. And in case my plans should be changed by unforeseen circumstances, I can always go to Plan B.",7
Some people trust their first impressions about a person's character because they believe these judgments are generally correct. Other people do not judge a person's character quickly because they believe first impressions are often wrong. Compare these two attitudes. Which attitude do you agree with?,"When we first meet someone, we know nothing about his or her character. However, we often make some assumptions based on the impression that the person makes. Can these first impressions be trusted? Some people believe that our initial judgment of a person is usually correct, while others think it is often wrong. There are arguments to support both positions.People who trust their first impressions believe that a person's appearance can be a good indication of not only his character, but also how he views himself and the people around him. It is true that we often send messages about our feelings without being aware of it. Body language is a good example of this. A person's posture, gestures and facial expression can tell us a lot about what he is thinking and feeling. Furthermore, dress and grooming can indicate whether someone cares enough about us to make a good impression.On the other hand, first impressions can sometimes be misleading. People may be nervous around others they don't know well or in an unfamiliar situation. This may cause them to act in ways that do not reflect their true character. Likewise, some people may give a false impression because they are trying too hard to impress. They may be consciously or unconsciously fooling the other person. In addition, a new acquaintance might simply be in a bad mood or not at his best for other reasons.Considering the arguments above, I believe that it is better not to judge a person's character too quickly. First impressions are, at best, an indication of how a person is feeling at the moment, and may not indicate his or her true character. However, due to the importance that many people do place on first impressions, we should be aware of the impression that we make on others. To sum up, I think we should not judge people according to first impressions, but we should take care to make a good impression ourselves.",8
Groups or organizations are an important part of some people's lives. Why are groups or organizations important to people?,"Most people belong to at least one group or organization. These groups of people include social clubs, special interest groups, sports teams, classmates and workmates. Such organizations play an important part in people's lives today because they provide both material and personal benefits.Both formal and informal organizations can provide their members with material benefits. For example, membership in an exercise class offers the benefit of improved health. In addition, organizations which work toward a specific goal, such as passing legislation or improving a neighborhood, allow people to achieve that goal more efficiently by working together. Finally, some organizations provide special benefits that are reserved for members, for example a music or book club in which the members exchange materials or receive special discounts.Most organizations also provide personal benefits, the most important of which is a sense of belonging. When people choose to ally themselves with a group, that becomes part of their identity. In the group, they can find people of like-minded interests and feel like part of a team. This gives the members both companionship and the opportunity to share their feelings with sympathetic listeners. Moreover, trying out different groups enables people to discover their interests and clarify their goals. Through this process they can find out where they best fit in.In conclusion, organizations and informal groups of people are important in our lives because they provide us with many advantages. They help us clarify our goals and interests and find the support we need to pursue them effectively. More importantly, they give us companionship and a sense of belonging.",7
Every generation of people is different in important ways. How is your generation different from your parents' generation?,"The world is constantly changing and so are the people in it. With each generation we see important developments that affect the way we think and live our lives. Therefore, it is not surprising that each generation of people is different from the one before, and my generation is no exception. My peers and I differ from our parents in several important ways, including our view of the world and our expectations of the future.People my age usually have a more global outlook than their parents. Unlike the previous generation, we have been exposed to a wide variety of information about the world from avery young age. We have benefited from technological advances such as satellite communications and the Internet. These have truly made the world a global village and we have been greatly influenced as a result. We are not only concerned about our traditional way of life, but also about our present way of life.Our expectations of the future are also different. This is due mainly to the greater prosperity and peace that we have known. Few of us have suffered true economic hardship and most take a good education and high standard of living for granted. Although we are willing to work hard to succeed, we also value our leisure time. We are more likely to spend money on recreational activities than start saving for our old age in our youth. Our prosperity has made us more materialistic than our parents, but also more carefree.Given our different circumstances, it is not surprising that we are so different from the previous generation. Our parents may shake their heads and worry over these changes, but no doubt their parents did the same. Rather than worry about what the next generation is coming to, I believe it is smarter to look for and appreciate the advantages in these developments.",7
"Describe some of the problems that overpopulation causes, and suggest at least one possible solution.","In most countries of the world the population is increasing alarmingly. This is especially true in poor, undeveloped countries. Overpopulation causes a considerable number of problems.In poor countries it is difficult to provide enough food to feed even the present number of people. In addition, education to limit the number of children per family is not always successful. Poorer countries usually have a lot of unemployment too, and an increase in population simply makes the situation worse. The environment also suffers when there are too many people living on the land.In rich, industrialized and developing countries it is very difficult for governments to provide effective public services in overcrowded cities. Moreover, there is usually a great deal more crime, which is often due to high rates of unemployment. Further large increases in population only cause more overcrowding, unemployment and crime.There are two main solutions to the overpopulation problem. Firstly, every woman who is pregnant but who does not want to give birth should be allowed by law to have an abortion. Secondly, governments must educate people to limit the size of the family. In China, couples are punished financially if they have more than one child. This may seem cruel, but the one-child policy"" is beginning to have an effect in the world's most populous nation. Eventually, similar policies might also be necessary in other crowded nations, such as India, for example.To sum up, if the population explosion continues, many more people will die of starvation in poor countries, and life in the cities, even in affluent nations, will become increasingly difficult.""",8
"In general, people are living longer now. Discuss the causes of this phenomenon.","People nowadays are living much longer than their counterparts in the past. In China, the average life expectancy has reportedly increased more than 4 years since 1990. Among various factors that contribute to this phenomenon are the continuously advancing food condition, the rapidly developing medical care system, and finally the current stable social and economic circumstance.The food condition overall is becoming better and better, and is an important factor that makes people live much longer than before. First of all, foods are more hygienic. People today drink untainted mineral water, and sterilized skim milk. Furthermore, foods are more nutritious, not to mention various carefully designed nutritious products.Of equal importance is the rapidly developing national medical care system. Development of modern technology has always been amazing. Certain diseases such as tuberculosis, pneumoma, and dysentery are now easy to remedy with low expense, but in the past, they are all probably lethal. Dental technology seems developed little except its exorbitantly charged bill, yet the simplest technology contributes to people's longevity most. It is not difficult to imagine that if an individual who lived in the past got a toothache, without certain dental care which is common today, he was certainly in an awful prospect:he might even die of a toothache!Finally, the current stable economic circumstance is also a great influential factor. Social and economic circumstance has a dramatic effect on people's life expectancy. It was reported that Russian life expectancy dropped from 70 to 58 shortly after the disintegration of the previous Soviet Union. Apparently, people have less pressure in a more stable society, and the less pressure they suffer, the healthier they are. At the same time, various types of insurance are readily available, which make people feel safe, therefore indirectly contributes significantly to longevity of people.",8
"With the increase in security awareness, security monitors are popping up in some places. Some are very useful, like the monitor eyeing the supermarket and the monitor checking traffic flows on roundabouts. But are monitors in the residential areas really necessary?","Recently, more and more residential districts have been installed with monitor cameras. It's said that the installation can vastly enhance the security of the residents. But some people are against it. The discussion as to whether the surveillance system is a blessing or a curse arouses most people's interests. In my opinion, I support that the monitor camera should be mounted in the residential areas.Installing monitor cameras is good for residents and the neighborhood. First of all, as what the advocates claim, it is an effective approach to improve the security situation. Consequently the guards can easily know what is going on in the districts from the screens of the monitor cameras, and they will be able to offer a helping hand to residents if it is necessary.Furthermore, the monitor cameras can be used to keep watch on the specified areas all day, so if something unusual happens, for example, a thief goes into a house and steals some valuable things, the police can review the records to find out some clues. It provides some valuable clues for the police to investigate and solve the case.Finally, if the monitor cameras have been installed in the residential districts, the people living there don't need to install the expensive security devices that they used to install. So the people living there can be spared lots of money on individual household safety devices.In conclusion, although installing monitor cameras has its negative effects, it can to a great extent make people feel more secure. That is a very important thing for people nowadays. Therefore I support installing the monitor cameras in the residential districts. The installation will undoubtedly play an increasingly significant role in modern life.",8
"Nowadays surveillance cameras are widely used in supermarkets. Some think that this is a violation of human rights, while others insist that they are for the benefit of the supermarkets. Discuss both sides of argument.","Nowadays supermarkets not only make a lot of money for their owners, but also bring them some trouble. How can they prevent theft without annoying their customers? The use of surveillance cameras seems a good solution. But more and more arguments arise with the increasing use of such cameras. Before giving my opinion, I think it is important to look at the arguments on both sides.Those who support using surveillance cameras in supermarkets insist that it is the vest way to protect the owners' profits. Firstly, a camera is more effective than security guards. One camera can easily cover an area for which 3–4 security guards are needed. Secondly, a camera is much more objective. Sometimes our eyes might deceive us, while a machine can record exactly what happens. It can prevent much unnecessary embarrassment.On the other hand, some people voice doubts about the installation of surveillance cameras. The most important reason for their disapproval is that such instruments show distrust of customers. Customers should not be watched suspiciously as if they were prisoners. Cameras can become evidence of a serious violation of human rights.All in all, the best solution is for both sides to respect each other's needs. The shopkeeper should place surveillance cameras in such a way that the customer does not feel that he or she is being spied upon. At the same time, the customer should respect the shopkeeper's concern about theft.",8
Participating in sports is important to physical health as well as spiritual health and social development. Do you agree?,"In China, people keep fit by participating in different sports including running, walking, cycling, playing badminton, tennis, table tennis, football, and so on. Most of them think that participating in sports is important to physical health only and has nothing to do with spiritual health and social development. Some even claim that participating in sports has negative effects on spiritual health and social development. However, in my opinion, it is beneficial to physical health as well as spiritual health and social development as a whole despite of some negative effects it has brought.Firstly, participating in sports can develop one's temperament and character spiritually. For example, if a person goes in for a kind of sport in which a team is involved, he needs to learn how to cooperate with other team members and how to adjust himself in an emergency. In addition, participating in sports can cultivate one's sense of honor and dignity. Athletes taking part in Olympic Games are such examples and those who have won the games are admired as heroes of the nation.Furthermore, participating in sports can hold people together and thus can indirectly stimulate the social development. Because sports are activities in which all participants enjoy absolute equality without any discrimination in any aspect, they can hold together people of different strata in society. As for professional athletes, it is also important for them to pay attention to their own education or cultural study; otherwise they will become spiritually unhealthy and intellectually barren men. It is not the fault of participating in sports though.Therefore, it is not difficult for us to come to the conclusion that physical exercises bring us great benefits. People from all walks of life should be encouraged to take up some kind of sports to help maintain a physically and mentally sound body and enrich their lives.",8
"Along with the amazing development of society, more and more people begin to realize that only peace can ensure human prosperity. In recent years, some people propose that compulsory military service should be abolished. Do you agree or not? Give your reasons.","In many countries, children are called upon for military service when they are 18 years old nowadays. Meanwhile, in China, especially in lots of universities, freshmen are required to take military training before they begin to study. It seems that it is a must in the growth-process of the young. However, is it proper to maintain military service in an era characterized by peace and development? This question is a very controversial one.We can't deny that we have benefited a lot from military service. Firstly, it offers a good way to strengthen a person not only physically but also psychologically. No matter how tired he becomes during the difficult training, he must clench his teeth and carry on. Gradually, a strong character can be built up. Secondly, military training arouses people's awareness of discipline and unity. In the army, everything is fixed. One must obey the rules and do what he is scheduled to do promptly. Also, teamwork spirit and unity are very important for soldiers if they want to achieve a task perfectly.Despite the advantages the military service has, it has some very serious disadvantages. In the army, no one is allowed to say no"" to an order. Such a discipline may possibly lead to bullying and conformity. ""Yes Boys"" and ""Yes Girls"" are found everywhere. Their lack of creativity and individuality will eventually turn into lack of vitality of their nation. What's more, it is a step away from peace. If it goes to extremeness, military service will inflict a fear called ""MILITARISM"" on us. People become militant. The threat of war will lead people all around the world into jeopardy.All these opinions make sense, and it is consequently hard to decide which one is more reasonable. In my opinion, we'd better popularize the military service properly and restrain its bad effects. We should make it a good way to maintain peace and create a better world for us to live in.""",8
Nowadays some people like to give help to the local community or provide people with direct help. Other people prefer to give money to national and international organizations. Discuss both of the two ways and present your own opinion.,"Nowadays, people have been attaching more and more attention to charity. However, when it comes to the actual approaches to be adopted to express their caring and loving, their opinions vary considerably. As for me, I believe each approach may have its own advantages and disadvantages and it's really hard to tell which one is the best choice.First, it is generally agreed that direct help is beneficial to both parties. On one hand, it offers a unique rewarding feeling to those who give help. Whenever they see the smile on the face of those who are helped, those who offer the help will undoubtedly acquire a sense of fulfillment, which will propel them to engage themselves more enthusiastically in the cause of charity. On the other hand, when others do not actually need any financial support, direct help, as a commonly-accepted form, seems to be indispensable. However, this form is usually only restricted to one's neighborhood.Second, compared with offering direct help, giving money to national and international organizations has been gaining increasing popularity among the public for its high efficiency and great convenience. There are times when people having the intention to help do not happen to have the time to do so. There are also times when people who offer help prefer to be behind the veil. Fortunately, all these problems have been solved with the appearance of many national and international charity organizations, which has made it possible to make the best use of the fund to help as many people as possible in the right way and at the best time. Nevertheless, a lack of administration and supervision over these organizations may trigger misuse of the fund or even corruption of the officials involved.Clearly, there are various ways to help others. What is the most important is whether one has a loving and sympathetic heart which drives him or her to extend a helping hand o those who await our help.",8
People have various ways of relieving stress. What are some of the ways that you find most effective in relieving stress? Give reasons and examples to support your response.,"The ways in which people relieve their stress are very much different: some cry, some laugh, some overdrink themselves and some dance wildly, and so on and so forth, to name just a few. However, the two most effective ways that work on me are sleeping in and taking long walks.Now let's look at many advantages of sleeping in. Sleeping in may help ease our nervousness and give our exhausted nerves a break. While under pressure, we tend to be impatient and easily lose our temper, which could only aggravate our feeling of pressure. Sleeping in once there is a chance can help adjust our nerves and this is conducive to getting over nervousness and tiredness. Furthermore, sleeping in can let us forget all about the stress for the time being. Once falling asleep, we would be free from thinking about the stress any longer and everything recedes to temporary tranquility, so when we wake up, the stress is not that strong anymore. Of course, we are unable to sleep in wherever we are and whenever we want to, rather, we need to find time, that is, when work allows us to do so.Next, let's take a look at some of the positive points of taking long walks. As we know, taking a walk itself is the best form of exercise that can help us keep fit, thus improving our capability to alleviate or eradicate pressure, which in turn makes for our long-term health. Meanwhile, taking long walks provides us with opportunities to enjoy the beauty of the surrounding sceneries and to think over the problems in our mind. Therefore, we are actually doing exercises, feasting our eyes on the sceneries and thinking about things at the same time: all three in one, which means that stress or pressure becomes only a small part of the whole process.In general, my own experience across the years has proved that the above-mentioned two ways are the most effective in terms of relieving and even eradicating stress, so I highly recommend them to you and hope they would produce the same effect on you.",8
Today's children are living under more pressure from society than children in the past. To what extent do you agree or disagree with the opinion?,"Nowadays children are growing up in more favorable conditions than ever before. However, they are also faced with much greater pressure than children in the past.Firstly, the burden with academic learning has become extremely heavy. It has become a trend for kids to take extra courses beyond their normal school curriculum, for parents believe that this can ensure their children a chance to a better university. And only a better university can ensure their kids a good job in the future. This would no doubt bring huge pressure to their children, affecting their health both physically and mentally.Secondly, the pressure of employment is becoming greater and greater. Statistics show that in 2007 about one million college graduates failed to find jobs. Most of them held bachelor's and even master's degrees. The fact that even well-educated people are confronted with unemployment problems urges children to obtain more skills and become more versatile so as to stay competitive on the job market.From the above discussion, we can easily come to a conclusion that children do live under more pressure than ever before. Under so much work and pressure, it is difficult for them to develop good personalities and interpersonal communication skills. They may become more solitary and even suffer from certain mental illnesses. Therefore, our government and society should create opportunities and reform our educational mechanism to let our kids enjoy their supposed happy childhood.",8
"As most people spend a major part of their adult life at work, job satisfaction is an important element of individual wellbeing. What factors contribute to job satisfaction? How realistic is the expectation of job satisfaction for all the workers?","Nowadays many adults have full-time jobs and the proportion of their lives spent doing such jobs is very high. So feeling about one's job must reflect how an individual feels about his or her life as a whole, and because of this, job satisfaction is indeed very important for the wellbeing of that person.Employees get job satisfaction in a number of ways. Firstly, a person needs to feel that they are doing valued and valuable work, so positive feedback from superiors is very important inthis respect. A sense of fulfilment is also encouraged if a worker feels the job is worth doing because it contributes to the society or the economy as a whole. Secondly, when someone feels they are improving or developing their skills through training opportunities, for example, then there is a sense of progression and purpose that rewards a worker. The sense of belonging to a team or a working community also contributes to job satisfaction because colleagues help each other to enjoy their working lives. Satisfaction is also increased by the sense of responsibility for and loyalty to a team.Of course not everybody enjoys their work. Hard economic realities mean that many people have little choice in the kind of job they can get. In some cases an employee is working in a job that suits neither their skills nor their personality. Some jobs are repetitive and boring, and labour relations may be poor and lead to resentment and insecurity rather than to job satisfaction.However, even though it is unlikely that all workers do feel happy in their work, I think it is not unrealistic to promote more job satisfaction in any job. If the factors identified above are implemented, then any job can be improved and more workers can feel greater degrees of job satisfaction.",8
"As society changes, more and more people do not want to stay in one career or job. Many people change their careers and jobs. What is the cause of this phenomenon? Can you give some suggestions to solve this problem?","With the development of our society, there is a growing discontent among people about a life-long career"". They are seeking experience in more than one field of work. Personally, I believe that there are several incentives contributing to this phenomenon and I will elaborate on them in this essay.In the first place, social developments have brought about a more flexible work style and work philosophy. It will be really difficult for modern people to see any point of getting retired from the place where their career got initiated. Instead, they are eager to try new things and gain fresh experience from frequent job-hopping, from which their life could be made more colorful and diversified.In the second place, another imperative motivation is that people, in most cases, change their jobs for a higher salary. Just like a saying goes, ""People strive upward."" According to statistics, the foremost reason that people change jobs is for a better pay. Consequently, if one can get a more appealing offer from some other employer, what's the point of staying in the original one?If some measures have to be taken to lessen or even eliminate this phenomenon, I reckon that companies should take up an inescapable responsibility through providing all their employees with a clear and transparent ladder of promotion as well as sufficient benefits in order to alleviate employees' impulses of leaving. What's more, especially in terms of job ethics and a sense of responsibility. In this way, people may form a more precise and mature attitude towards career and thus not being carried away by this ever-changing fickle world.From all that have been discussed above, we can draw a safe conclusion that there are various causes for people's frequent job-hopping. There is much left to be done if we really want to alter this situation.""",8
"Some people prefer to stay in the same job for the same company, but others prefer to change jobs frequently. You should use specific reasons to compare the advantages and disadvantages of both sides.","In modern society, employment is based on mutual options between companies and individuals rather than unilateral decisions of companies. Therefore, some people are able to change jobs frequently while others still prefer to stay in the same job for the same company. From my point of view, both sides have their own advantages and disadvantages.Let us have a touch on the former attitude towards career first. The people who prefer to frequently change jobs, usually called job hoppers"", are bound to have more opportunities to develop their personal abilities as well as sociable skills. As a result, they may possess more enthusiasm and ambition when confronted with work, and they may behave more creatively and efficiently when challenged by various tasks. However, due to the instability of their jobs, they are generally suffering great pressure, stress and intolerable mental pains. They have no other choices but to enforce themselves to keep up with the fast-paced jobs so that they even forget how to relax.On the other hand, there are also people who prefer to stay in the same job for the same company. The advantages of this attitude towards career consist in the relatively stable income and less competitive stress under most circumstances. Besides, as their working experience increases, they are more likely to acquire promotion or have their pay raised. Nevertheless, we all regard it a natural truth that every coin has two sides. Compared with people holding the former attitude, the latter have their own disadvantages, such as the same old routine work and narrow horizon.As compared and analyzed above, both attitudes towards career have their advantages and disadvantages. In terms of which side you will stand by or which attitude you will adopt, it is none of others' business but really up to you.题目:有些人喜欢在同一家公司做同样的事情, 但是其他人宁愿不断跳槽。论述从事不同的工作和从事同一种工作的利弊。译文:当今社会, 工作是以公司和个人共同选择为基础的, 而不是公司单方面的选择。因此当别人还在选择在同一家公司做同一件事情时, 一些人已经频繁换工作。针对这种现象我认为各有利弊。首先我们借前者的职业观来说。想经常换工作的人通常叫""工作漏斗""。他们想拥有更多的机会去提高个人能力和社交技能, 面对工作可以有更多的热情和抱负。在他们挑战不同工作时, 他们将会获得更多的创造力和更高的效率。不过由于脑力劳动通常会给他们带来很大压力以及无法忍受的脑力劳动之苦。他们别无选择, 只能强迫自己加快节奏地完成那些工作, 甚至忘记如何去放松。另一方面, 也有人更喜欢待在同一家公司做同样的事情。这种职业观的优点是, 在大多数情况下能有一个相对稳定的收入和没有太大的竞争压力。此外, 他们的工作经验也会有所提高, 也更有可能提高自己从而得到更多的薪水。然而, 我们要关注这样一个事实, 任何事物都具有两面性。相对而言, 人们比较支持前者的观点, 认为后者有不少缺点。比如说, 同样的惯例工作和狭隘的视野。根据以上的对比和分析, 关于职业的两种观点都各有利弊。对于这些说法你可以不在意或采用任何一种, 这与别人没关系, 还是得自己拿主意。208. 任何人都可以成为运动员或者音乐家Topic:It is generally believed that some people are born with certain talents, for instance for sport or music, and others are not. However, it is sometimes claimed that any child can be taught to become a good sports person or musician. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Sample AnswerThe relative importance of natural talent and training is a frequent topic of discussion when people try to explain different levels of ability in, for example, sport, art, or music.Obviously, education systems are based on the belief that all children can effectively be taught to acquire different skills, including those associated with sport, art, or music. So from our own schools experience, we can find plenty of evidence to support the view that a child can acquire these skills with continued teaching and guided practice.However, some people believe that innate talent is what differentiates a person who has been trained to play a sport or an instrument, from those who become good players. In other words, there is more to the skill than a learned technique, and this extra talent cannot be taught, no matter how good the teacher or how frequently a child practices.I personally think that some people do have talents that are probably inherited via gene. Such talents can give individuals a facility for certain skills that allow them to excel, while more hard-working students never mange to reach a comparable level. But, as with all questions of nature versus nurture, they are not mutually exclusive. Good musicians or artists and exceptional sport stars have probably succeeded because of both good training and natural talent. Without the natural, continuous training would be neither attractive nor productive, and without the training, the child would not learn how to exploit and develop their talent.In conclusion, I agree any child can be taught particular skills, but to be really good in areas such as music, art or sport, then some natural talent is required.""",8
Research indicates that the characteristics we are born with have much more influence on our personality and development than any experiences we may have in our life. Which do you consider to be the major influence?,"Today the way we consider human psychology and mental development is heavily influenced by the genetic sciences. We now understand the importance of inherited characteristics more than ever before. Yet we are still unable to decide whether an individual's personality and development are more influenced by genetic factors or by the environment.Research, related to identical twins, has highlighted how significant inherited characteristics can be for an individual's life. But whether these characteristics are able to develop within the personality of an individual surely depends on whether the circumstances allow such a development. It seems that the experiences we have in life are so unpredictable and so powerful that they can boost or over-ride other influences, and there seems to be plenty of research findings to confirm this.My own view is that there is no one major influence in a person's life. Instead, the traits we inherit from our parents and the situations and experiences that we encounter in life are constantly interacting. It is the interaction of the two that shapes a person's personality and dictates how that personality develops. If this were not true, then we would be able to predict the behavior and character of a person from the moment they were born.In conclusion, I do not think that either nature or nurture is the major influence on a person, but that both have powerful effects. How these factors interact is still unknown today and they remain largely unpredictable in a person's life.",8
"Nature and nurture, which plays a major role in the personality and development of children?","In children's development of personality, which plays a major part, nature or nurture? As I see it, nurture is as important as, if not more important than nature.Family does play a significant role in shaping children's inclination and character. After one is born, the first and nearest surroundings is the family in which he will grow up. Parents are the first teachers to their children. Every day, parents' speech and action influence the mental and physical development of their children who tend to follow what their parents do. Because the family is children's most direct source of knowledge and other experience, those who are brought up in good family tend to possess many pleasant characters.When a child becomes old enough to communicate with other children, he begins having friends who sometimes influence him more rapidly than do families. By associating with friends, one can gradually get into the society and become sociable. To some extent, man is a sociable creature so that children should understand the society, get used to it, and get pleasure out of it. To this point, friends would help. As for me, I have lots of friends who have many different opinions and personalities. Discussing with them enriches my thought, and playing with them builds up my personality.Some people advocate the role of nature in molding children's characteristics. They take for example some of famous families in the world, which brought up many scientists, such as Bernoullis. But it should be a forceful example to demonstrate the importance of the family's nurture.If you want to succeed, do not rely on the nature. To achieve your goal needs the efforts of yourself. God helps those who help themselves.",7
"When people succeed, it is because of hard work. Luck has nothing to do with success.Do you agree or disagree with the quotation above? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your position.","Success is always what human beings chase. Someone succeeds for his luck while someone succeeds for his hard work. As far as I am concerned, I fully agree with the claim that there is no correlation between success and luck.First of all, an education is the key factor of success. One wishing to be admitted to the university will have to take several tests. It is doubtful that someone will be so lucky that knowing nothing, he could pass the test with a high score. Therefore, in order to be successful, one should prepare for the tests and work hard, because a good education will provide him with a good job and an opportunity to accomplish some of his goals and dreams. In my lifetime, I have never met a person who could graduate from a college without working hard.Secondly, it is impossible to make a career if one is lacking knowledge. Luck plays no role in achieving this success. Even if someone was unbelievably lucky enough to become a manager, not being qualified enough, he will be asked to resign in the near future because of his inability due to lack of knowledge and experience to make right decisions. For instance, I used to work for a very small company owned by a friend. Although he had no knowledge or experience in business, the company had been profitable for a short time, which he attributed to his luck. But this company was finally closed because of the wrong strategies and decisions made by him.On the other hand, it can not be denied that many businessmen become successful only for their new ideas, not for their long time of hard work and many people having done a lot of work still can not be successful men. Sometimes luck may play an important role in success. But it is mainly acting through one's diligent work. It is the hard work that leads us to the front of luck.In sum, success is every person's pursuit. We always dream that someday we will be successful businessmen, famous scientists, or distinguished politicians. All of these things are simply not possible without hard work. Luck has no place in such a scheme of events.",7
