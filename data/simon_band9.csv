"Families who send their children to private schools should not berequired to pay taxes that support the state education system.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","should not need to contribute to state schools through taxes. Personally,I completely disagree with this view.
For a variety of reasons, it would be wrong to reduce taxes for familieswho pay for private education. Firstly, it would be difficult to calculate thecorrect amount of tax reduction for these families, and staff would berequired to manage this complex process. Secondly, we all pay a certainamount of tax for public services that we may not use. For example, mostpeople are fortunate enough not to have to call the police or fire brigadeat any time in their lives, but they would not expect a tax reduction forthis. Finally, if wealthy families were given a tax discount for sending theirchildren to private schools, we might have a situation where poorerpeople pay higher taxes than the rich.
In my opinion, we should all be happy to pay our share of the money thatsupports public schools. It is beneficial for all members of society to havea high quality education system with equal opportunities for all youngpeople. This will result in a well-educated workforce, and in turn a moreproductive and prosperous nation. Parents of children in private schoolsmay also see the advantages of this in their own lives. For example, acompany owner will need well qualified and competent staff, and a well-funded education system can provide such employees.
In conclusion, I do not believe that any financial concessions should bemade for people who choose private education.",9
"only be concerned with our own communities and countries.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","Some people believe that we should not help people in other countriesas long as there are problems in our own society. I disagree with this viewbecause I believe that we should try to help as many people as possible.
On the one hand, I accept that it is important to help our neighbours andfellow citizens. In most communities there are people who areimpoverished or disadvantaged in some way. It is possible to findhomeless people, for example, in even the wealthiest of cities, and forthose who are concerned about this problem, there are usuallyopportunities to volunteer time or give money to support these people. Inthe UK, people can help in a variety of ways, from donating clothing toserving free food in a soup kitchen. As the problems are on our doorstep,and there are obvious ways to help, I can understand why some peoplefeel that we should prioritise local charity.
At the same time, I believe that we have an obligation to help those wholive beyond our national borders. In some countries the problems thatpeople face are much more serious than those in our own communities,and it is often even easier to help. For example, when children are dyingfrom curable diseases in African countries, governments and individualsin richer countries can save lives simply by paying for vaccines thatalready exist. A small donation to an international charity might have amuch greater impact than helping in our local area.
In conclusion, it is true that we cannot help everyone, but in my opinionnational boundaries should not stop us from helping those who are inneed.",9
There are many different types of music in the world today. Why dowe need music? Is the traditional music of a country more importantthan the international music that is heard everywhere nowadays?,"It is true that a rich variety of musical styles can be found around theworld. Music is a vital part of all human cultures for a range of reasons,and I would argue that traditional music is more important than modern,international music.
Music is something that accompanies all of us throughout our lives. Aschildren, we are taught songs by our parents and teachers as a meansof learning language, or simply as a form of enjoyment. Children delightin singing with others, and it would appear that the act of singing in agroup creates a connection between participants, regardless of their age.
Later in life, people's musical preferences develop, and we come to seeour favourite songs as part of our life stories. Music both expresses andarouses emotions in a way that words alone cannot. In short, it is difficultto imagine life without it.
In my opinion, traditional music should be valued over the internationalmusic that has become so popular. International pop music is oftencatchy and fun, but it is essentially a commercial product that is marketedand sold by business people. Traditional music, by contrast, expressesthe culture, customs and history of a country. Traditional styles, such as...(example)..., connect us to the past and form part of our culturalidentity. It would be a real pity if pop music became so predominant thatthese national styles disappeared.
In conclusion, music is a necessary part of human existence, and Ibelieve that traditional music should be given more importance thaninternational music.",9
Some people think that all teenagers should be required to dounpaid work in their free time to help the local community. Theybelieve this would benefit both the individual teenager and societyas a whole. Do you agree or disagree?,"Many young people work on a volunteer basis, and this can only bebeneficial for both the individual and society as a whole. However, I donot agree that we should therefore force all teenagers to do unpaid work.
Most young people are already under enough pressure with their studies,without being given the added responsibility of working in their sparetime. School is just as demanding as a full-time job, and teachers expecttheir students to do homework and exam revision on top of attendinglessons every day. When young people do have some free time, weshould encourage them to enjoy it with their friends or to spend it doingsports and other leisure activities. They have many years of work aheadof them when they finish their studies.
At the same time, I do not believe that society has anything to gain fromobliging young people to do unpaid work. In fact, I would argue that itgoes against the values of a free and fair society to force a group ofpeople to do something against their will. Doing this can only lead toresentment amongst young people, who would feel that they were beingused, and parents, who would not want to be told how to raise theirchildren. Currently, nobody is forced to volunteer, and this is surely thebest system.
In conclusion, teenagers may choose to work for free and help others,but in my opinion we should not make this compulsory.",9
Some people believe that hobbies need to be difficult to be enjoyableTo what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some hobbies are relatively easy, while others present more of achallenge. Personally, I believe that both types of hobby can be fun, andI therefore disagree with the statement that hobbies need to be difficult inorder to be enjoyable.
On the one hand, many people enjoy easy hobbies. One example of anactivity that is easy for most people is swimming. This hobby requiresvery little equipment, it is simple to learn, and it is inexpensive. Iremember learning to swim at my local swimming pool when I was a child,and it never felt like a demanding or challenging experience. Anotherhobby that I find easy and fun is photography. In my opinion, anyone cantake interesting pictures without knowing too much about thetechnicalities of operating a camera. Despite being straightforward,taking photos is a satisfying activity.
On the other hand, difficult hobbies can sometimes be more exciting. Ifan activity is more challenging, we might feel a greater sense ofsatisfaction when we manage to do it successfully. For example, filmediting is a hobby that requires a high level of knowledge and expertise.
In my case, it took me around two years before I became competent atthis activity, but now I enjoy it much more than I did when I started. Ibelieve that many hobbies give us more pleasure when we reach a higherlevel of performance because the results are better and the feeling ofachievement is greater.
In conclusion, simple hobbies can be fun and relaxing, but difficulthobbies can be equally pleasurable for different reasons.",9
"In the developed world, average life expectancy is increasing. Whatproblems will this cause for individuals and society? Suggest somemeasures that could be taken to reduce the impact of ageingpopulations.","It is true that people in industrialised nations can expect to live longerthan ever before. Although there will undoubtedly be some negativeconsequences of this trend, societies can take steps to mitigate thesepotential problems.
As people live longer and the populations of developed countries growolder, several related problems can be anticipated. The main issue is thatthere will obviously be more people of retirement age who will be eligibleto receive a pension. The proportion of younger, working adults will besmaller, and governments will therefore receive less money in taxes inrelation to the size of the population. In other words, an ageing populationwill mean a greater tax burden for working adults. Further pressures willinclude a rise in the demand for healthcare, and the fact young adults willincreasingly have to look after their elderly relatives.
There are several actions that governments could take to solve theproblems described above. Firstly, a simple solution would be to increasethe retirement age for working adults, perhaps from 65 to 70. Nowadays,people of this age tend to be healthy enough to continue a productiveworking life. A second measure would be for governments to encourageimmigration in order to increase the number of working adults who paytaxes. Finally, money from national budgets will need to be taken fromother areas and spent on vital healthcare, accommodation and transportfacilities for the rising numbers of older citizens.
In conclusion, various measures can be taken to tackle the problems thatare certain to arise as the populations of countries grow older.",9
"Some people regard video games as harmless fun, or even as auseful educational tool. Others, however, believe that videos gamesare having an adverse effect on the people who play them. In youropinion, do the drawbacks of video games outweigh the benefits?","Many people, and children in particular, enjoy playing computer games.
While I accept that these games can sometimes have a positive effect onthe user, I believe that they are more likely to have a harmful impact.
On the one hand, video games can be both entertaining and educational.
Users, or gamers, are transported into virtual worlds which are often moreexciting and engaging than real-life pastimes. From an educationalperspective, these games encourage imagination and creativity, as wellas concentration, logical thinking and problem solving, all of which areuseful skills outside the gaming context. Furthermore, it has been shownthat computer simulation games can improve users' motor skills and helpto prepare them for real-world tasks, such as flying a plane.
However, I would argue that these benefits are outweighed by thedrawbacks. Gaming can be highly addictive because users areconstantly given scores, new targets and frequent rewards to keep themplaying. Many children now spend hours each day trying to progressthrough the levels of a game or to get a higher score than their friends.
This type of addiction can have effects ranging from lack of sleep toproblems at school, when homework is sacrificed for a few more hourson the computer or console. The rise in obesity in recent years has alsobeen linked in part to the sedentary lifestyle and lack of exercise thatoften accompany gaming addiction.
In conclusion, it seems to me that the potential dangers of video gamesare more significant than the possible benefits.",9
Foreign visitors should pay more than local visitors for cultural andhistorical attractions. To what extent do you agree or disagree withthis opinion?,"more than local residents to visit important sites and monuments. Icompletely disagree with this idea.
The argument in favour of higher prices for foreign tourists would be thatcultural or historical attractions often depend on state subsidies to keepthem going, which means that the resident population already paysmoney to these sites through the tax system. However, I believe this tobe a very shortsighted view. Foreign tourists contribute to the economyof the host country with the money they spend on a wide range of goodsand services, including food, souvenirs, accommodation and travel. Thegovernments and inhabitants of every country should be happy tosubsidise important tourist sites and encourage people from the rest ofthe world to visit them.
If travellers realised that they would have to pay more to visit historicaland cultural attractions in a particular nation, they would perhaps decidenot to go to that country on holiday. To take the UK as an example, thetourism industry and many related jobs rely on visitors coming to thecountry to see places like Windsor Castle or Saint Paul's Cathedral.
These two sites charge the same price regardless of nationality, and thishelps to promote the nation's cultural heritage. If overseas touristsstopped coming due to higher prices, there would be a risk of insufficientfunding for the maintenance of these important buildings.
In conclusion, I believe that every effort should be made to attract touristsfrom overseas, and it would be counterproductive to make them pay morethan local residents.",9
"Some people think that governments should give financial supportto creative artists such as painters and musicians. Others believethat creative artists should be funded by alternative sources.
Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","People have different views about the funding of creative artists. Whilesome people disagree with the idea of government support for artists, Ibelieve that money for art projects should come from both governmentsand other sources.
Some art projects definitely require help from the state. In the UK, thereare many works of art in public spaces, such as streets or squares in citycentres. In Liverpool, for example, there are several new statues andsculptures in the docks area of the city, which has been redevelopedrecently. These artworks represent culture, heritage and history. Theyserve to educate people about the city, and act as landmarks or talkingpoints for visitors and tourists. Governments and local councils shouldpay creative artists to produce this kind of art, because without theirfunding our cities would be much less interesting and attractive.
On the other hand, I can understand the arguments against governmentfunding for art. The main reason for this view is that governments havemore important concerns. For example, state budgets need to be spenton education, healthcare, infrastructure and security, among other areas.
These public services are vital for a country to function properly, whereasthe work of creative artists, even in public places, is a luxury. Anotherreason for this opinion is that artists do a job like any other professional,and they should therefore earn their own money by selling their work.
In conclusion, there are good reasons why artists should rely onalternative sources of financial support, but in my opinion governmenthelp is sometimes necessary.",9
"Nowadays animal experiments are widely used to develop newmedicines and to test the safety of other products. Some peopleargue that these experiments should be banned because it ismorally wrong to cause animals to suffer, while others are in favourof them because of their benefits to humanity.
Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","It is true that medicines and other products are routinely tested onanimals before they are cleared for human use. While I tend towards theviewpoint that animal testing is morally wrong, I would have to support alimited amount of animal experimentation for the development ofmedicines.
On the one hand, there are clear ethical arguments against animalexperimentation. To use a common example of this practice, laboratorymice may be given an illness so that the effectiveness of a new drug canbe measured. Opponents of such research argue that humans have noright to subject animals to this kind of trauma, and that the lives of allcreatures should be respected. They believe that the benefits to humansdo not justify the suffering caused, and that scientists should usealternative methods of research.
On the other hand, reliable alternatives to animal experimentation maynot always be available. Supporters of the use of animals in medicalresearch believe that a certain amount of suffering on the part of mice orrats can be justified if human lives are saved. They argue that opponentsof such research might feel differently if a member of their own familiesneeded a medical treatment that had been developed through the use ofanimal experimentation. Personally, I agree with the banning of animaltesting for non-medical products, but I feel that it may be a necessary evilwhere new drugs and medical procedures are concerned.
In conclusion, it seems to me that it would be wrong to ban testing onanimals for vital medical research until equally effective alternatives havebeen developed.",9
"between equality and personal achievement. Some people believethat individuals can achieve more in egalitarian societies. Othersbelieve that high levels of personal achievement are possible onlyif individuals are free to succeed or fail according to their individualmerits.
What is your view of the relationship between equality and personalsuccess?","In my opinion, an egalitarian society is one in which everyone has thesame rights and the same opportunities. I completely agree that peoplecan achieve more in this kind of society.
Education is an important factor with regard to personal success in life. Ibelieve that all children should have access to free schooling, and highereducation should be either free or affordable for all those who chose topursue a university degree. In a society without free schooling oraffordable higher education, only children and young adults fromwealthier families would have access to the best learning opportunities,and they would therefore be better prepared for the job market. This kindof inequality would ensure the success of some but harm the prospectsof others.
I would argue that equal rights and opportunities are not in conflict withpeople's freedom to succeed or fail. In other words, equality does notmean that people lose their motivation to succeed, or that they are notallowed to fail. On the contrary, I believe that most people would feelmore motivated to work hard and reach their potential if they thought thatthey lived in a fair society. Those who did not make the same effort wouldknow that they had wasted their opportunity. Inequality, on the otherhand, would be more likely to demotivate people because they wouldknow that the odds of success were stacked in favour of those fromprivileged backgrounds.
In conclusion, it seems to me that there is a positive relationship betweenequality and personal success.",9
Explain some of the ways in which humans are damaging theenvironment. What can governments do to address theseproblems? What can individual people do?,"Humans are responsible for a variety of environmental problems, but wecan also take steps to reduce the damage that we are causing to theplanet. This essay will discuss environmental problems and themeasures that governments and individuals can take to address theseproblems.
Two of the biggest threats to the environment are air pollution and waste.
Gas emissions from factories and exhaust fumes from vehicles lead toglobal warming, which may have a devastating effect on the planet in thefuture. As the human population increases, we are also producing evergreater quantities of waste, which contaminates the earth and pollutesrivers and oceans.
Governments could certainly make more effort to reduce air pollution.
They could introduce laws to limit emissions from factories or to forcecompanies to use renewable energy from solar, wind or water power.
They could also impose 'green taxes' on drivers and airline companies.
In this way, people would be encouraged to use public transport and totake fewer flights abroad, therefore reducing emissions.
Individuals should also take responsibility for the impact they have on theenvironment. They can take public transport rather than driving, chooseproducts with less packaging, and recycle as much as possible. Mostsupermarkets now provide reusable bags for shoppers as well as 'banks'for recycling glass, plastic and paper in their car parks. By reusing andrecycling, we can help to reduce waste.
In conclusion, both national governments and individuals must play theirpart in looking after the environment.",9
Universities should accept equal numbers of male and femalestudents in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In my opinion, men and women should have the same educationalopportunities. However, I do not agree with the idea of accepting equalproportions of each gender in every university subject.
Having the same number of men and women on all degree courses issimply unrealistic. Student numbers on any course depend on theapplications that the institution receives. If a university decided to fillcourses with equal numbers of males and females, it would need enoughapplicants of each gender. In reality, many courses are more popular withone gender than the other, and it would not be practical to aim for equalproportions. For example, nursing courses tend to attract more femaleapplicants, and it would be difficult to fill these courses if fifty per cent ofthe places needed to go to males.
Apart from the practical concerns expressed above, I also believe that itwould be unfair to base admission to university courses on gender.
Universities should continue to select the best candidates for each courseaccording to their qualifications. In this way, both men and women havethe same opportunities, and applicants know that they will be successfulif they work hard to achieve good grades at school. If a female student isthe best candidate for a place on a course, it is surely wrong to reject herin favour of a male student with lower grades or fewer qualifications.
In conclusion, the selection of university students should be based onmerit, and it would be both impractical and unfair to change to a selectionprocedure based on gender.",9
"Some people think that museums should be enjoyable places toentertain people, while others believe that the purpose of museumsis to educate.
Discuss both views and give you own opinion.","People have different views about the role and function of museums. Inmy opinion, museums can and should be both entertaining andeducational.
On the one hand, it can be argued that the main role of a museum is toentertain. Museums are tourist attractions, and their aim is to exhibit acollection of interesting objects that many people will want to see. Theaverage visitor may become bored if he or she has to read or listen to toomuch educational content, so museums often put more of an emphasison enjoyment rather than learning. This type of museum is designed tobe visually spectacular, and may have interactive activities or evengames as part of its exhibitions.
On the other hand, some people argue that museums should focus oneducation. The aim of any exhibition should be to teach visitorssomething that they did not previously know. Usually this means that thehistory behind the museum's exhibits needs to be explained, and this canbe done in various ways. Some museums employ professional guides totalk to their visitors, while other museums offer headsets so that visitorscan listen to detailed commentary about the exhibition. In this way,museums can play an important role in teaching people about history,culture, science and many other aspects of life.
In conclusion, it seems to me that a good museum should be able to offeran interesting, enjoyable and educational experience so that people canhave fun and learn something at the same time.",9
"Some people believe that studying at university or college is thebest route to a successful career, while others believe that it isbetter to get a job straight after school.
Discuss both views and give your opinion.","When they finish school, teenagers face the dilemma of whether to get ajob or continue their education. While there are some benefits to gettinga job straight after school, I would argue that it is better to go to collegeor university.
The option to start work straight after school is attractive for severalreasons. Many young people want to start earning money as soon aspossible. In this way, they can become independent, and they will be ableto afford their own house or start a family. In terms of their career, youngpeople who decide to find work, rather than continue their studies, mayprogress more quickly. They will have the chance to gain real experienceand learn practical skills related to their chosen profession. This may leadto promotions and a successful career.
On the other hand, I believe that it is more beneficial for students tocontinue their studies. Firstly, academic qualifications are required inmany professions. For example, it is impossible to become a doctor,teacher or lawyer without having the relevant degree. As a result,university graduates have access to more and better job opportunities,and they tend to earn higher salaries than those with fewer qualifications.
Secondly, the job market is becoming increasingly competitive, andsometimes there are hundreds of applicants for one position in acompany. Young people who do not have qualifications from a universityor college will not be able to compete.
For the reasons mentioned above, it seems to me that students are morelikely to be successful in their careers if they continue their studiesbeyond school level.",9
"Several languages are in danger of extinction because they arespoken by very small numbers of people. Some people say thatgovernments should spend public money on saving theselanguages, while others believe that would be a waste of money.
Discuss both these views and give your opinion.","It is true that some minority languages may disappear in the near future.
Although it can be argued that governments could save money byallowing this to happen, I believe that these languages should beprotected and preserved.
There are several reasons why saving minority languages could be seenas a waste of money. Firstly, if a language is only spoken by a smallnumber of people, expensive education programmes will be needed tomake sure that more people learn it, and the state will have to pay forfacilities, teachers and marketing. This money might be better spent onother public services. Secondly, it would be much cheaper and moreefficient for countries to have just one language. Governments could cutall kinds of costs related to communicating with each minority group.
Despite the above arguments, I believe that governments should try topreserve languages that are less widely spoken. A language is muchmore than simply a means of communication; it has a vital connectionwith the cultural identity of the people who speak it. If a languagedisappears, a whole way of life will disappear with it, and we will lose therich cultural diversity that makes societies more interesting. By spendingmoney to protect minority languages, governments can also preservetraditions, customs and behaviours that are part of a country's history.
In conclusion, it may save money in the short term if we allow minoritylanguages to disappear, but in the long term this would have an extremelynegative impact on our cultural heritage.",9
"Nowadays the way many people interact with each other haschanged because of technology.
In what ways has technology affected the types of relationships thatpeople make? Has this been a positive or negative development?","It is true that new technologies have had an influence on communicationbetween people. Technology has affected relationships in various ways,and in my opinion there are both positive and negative effects.
Technology has had an impact on relationships in business, educationand social life. Firstly, telephones and the Internet allow business peoplein different countries to interact without ever meeting eachother. Secondly, services like Skype create new possibilities forrelationships between students and teachers. For example, a student cannow take video lessons with a teacher in a different city orcountry. Finally, many people use social networks, like Facebook, tomake new friends and find people who share common interests, and theyinteract through their computers rather than face to face.
On the one hand, these developments can be extremely positive.
Cooperation between people in different countries was much moredifficult when communication was limited to written letters or telegrams.
Nowadays, interactions by email, phone or video are almost as good asface-to-face meetings, and many of us benefit from these interactions,either in work or social contexts. On the other hand, the availability of newcommunication technologies can also have the result of isolating peopleand discouraging real interaction. For example, many young peoplechoose to make friends online rather than mixing with their peers in thereal world, and these 'virtual' relationships are a poor substitute for realfriendships.
In conclusion, technology has certainly revolutionised communicationbetween people, but not all of the outcomes of this revolution have beenpositive.",9
"Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealththan for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to youngpeople.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","It is true that some celebrities are known for their glamorous lifestylesrather than for the work they do. While I agree that these celebrities seta bad example for children, I believe that other famous people act aspositive role models.
On the one hand, many people do achieve fame without really workingfor it. They may have inherited money from parents, married a famous orwealthy person, or they may have appeared in gossip magazines or on areality TV programme. A good example would be Paris Hilton, who is richand famous for the wrong reasons. She spends her time attending partiesand nightclubs, and her behaviour promotes the idea that appearance,glamour and media profile are more important than hard work and goodcharacter. The message to young people is that success can be achievedeasily, and that school work is not necessary.
On the other hand, there are at least as many celebrities whoseaccomplishments make them excellent role models for young people.
Actors, musicians and sports stars become famous idols because theyhave worked hard and applied themselves to develop real skills andabilities. They demonstrate great effort, determination and ambition,which is required for someone who wants to be truly successful in theirchosen field. An example is the actor and martial artist Jackie Chan, whohas become world famous through years of practice and hard work. Thiskind of self-made celebrity can inspire children to develop their talentsthrough application and perseverance.",9
"When choosing a job, the salary is the most importantconsideration. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Many people choose their jobs based on the size of the salary offered.
Personally, I disagree with the idea that money is the key considerationwhen deciding on a career, because I believe that other factors areequally important.
On the one hand, I agree that money is necessary in order for people tomeet their basic needs. For example, we all need money to pay forhousing, food, bills, health care, and education. Most people consider ita priority to at least earn a salary that allows them to cover these needsand have a reasonable quality of life. If people chose their jobs based onenjoyment or other non-financial factors, they might find it difficult tosupport themselves. Artists and musicians, for instance, are known forchoosing a career path that they love, but that does not always providethem with enough money to live comfortably and raise a family.
Nevertheless, I believe that other considerations are just as important aswhat we earn in our jobs. Firstly, personal relationships and theatmosphere in a workplace are extremely important when choosing a job.
Having a good manager or friendly colleagues, for example, can make ahuge difference to workers' levels of happiness and general quality of life.
Secondly, many people's feelings of job satisfaction come from theirprofessional achievements, the skills they learn, and the position theyreach, rather than the money they earn. Finally, some people choose acareer because they want to help others and contribute somethingpositive to society.
In conclusion, while salaries certainly affect people's choice ofprofession, I do not believe that money outweighs all other motivators.",9
"Some people think that in the modern world we are more dependenton each other, while others think that people have become moreindependent. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","dependent on others nowadays. In my view, modern life forces us to bemore independent than people were in the past.
There are two main reasons why it could be argued that we are moredependent on each other now. Firstly, life is more complex and difficult,especially because the cost of living has increased so dramatically. Forexample, young adults tend to rely on their parents for help when buyinga house. Property prices are higher than ever, and without help it wouldbe impossible for many people to pay a deposit and a mortgage.
Secondly, people seem to be more ambitious nowadays, and they wanta better quality of life for their families. This means that both parentsusually need to work full-time, and they depend on support fromgrandparents and babysitters for child care.
However, I would agree with those who believe that people are moreindependent these days. In most countries, families are becomingsmaller and more dispersed, which means that people cannot count onrelatives as much as they used to. We also have more freedom to traveland live far away from our home towns. For example, many studentschoose to study abroad instead of going to their local university, and thisexperience makes them more independent as they learn to live alone.
Another factor in this growing independence is technology, which allowsus to work alone and from any part of the world.
In conclusion, while there are some reasons to believe that people nowdepend on each other more, my own view is that we are moreindependent than ever.",9
"Wild animals have no place in the 21st century, so protecting themis a waste of resources. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Some people argue that it is pointless to spend money on the protectionof wild animals because we humans have no need for them. I completelydisagree with this point of view.
In my opinion, it is absurd to argue that wild animals have no place in the21st century. I do not believe that planet Earth exists only for the benefitof humans, and there is nothing special about this particular century thatmeans that we suddenly have the right to allow or encourage theextinction of any species. Furthermore, there is no compelling reasonwhy we should let animals die out. We do not need to exploit or destroyevery last square metre of land in order to feed or accommodate theworld's population. There is plenty of room for us to exist side by sidewith wild animals, and this should be our aim.
I also disagree with the idea that protecting animals is a waste ofresources. It is usually the protection of natural habitats that ensures thesurvival of wild animals, and most scientists agree that these habitats arealso crucial for human survival. For example, rainforests produce oxygen,absorb carbon dioxide and stabilise the Earth's climate. If we destroyedthese areas, the costs of managing the resulting changes to our planetwould far outweigh the costs of conservation. By protecting wild animalsand their habitats, we maintain the natural balance of all life on Earth.
In conclusion, we have no right to decide whether or not wild animalsshould exist, and I believe that we should do everything we can to protectthem.",9
"Happiness is considered very important in life.
Why is it difficult to define?
What factors are important in achieving happiness?","It is no doubt true that the majority of people would like to be happy intheir lives. While the personal nature of happiness makes it difficult todescribe, there do seem to be some common needs that we all sharewith regard to experiencing or achieving happiness.
Happiness is difficult to define because it means something different toeach individual person. Nobody can fully understand or experienceanother person's feelings, and we all have our own particular passionsfrom which we take pleasure. Some people, for example, derive a senseof satisfaction from earning money or achieving success, whereas forothers, health and family are much more important. At the same time, arange of other feelings, from excitement to peacefulness, may beassociated with the idea of happiness, and the same person maytherefore feel happy in a variety of different ways.
Although it seems almost impossible to give a precise definition ofhappiness, most people would agree that there are some basicpreconditions to achieving it. Firstly, it is hard for a person to be happy ifhe or she does not have a safe place to live and enough food to eat. Ourbasic survival needs must surely be met before we can lead a pleasantlife. Secondly, the greatest joy in life is usually found in sharedexperiences with family and friends, and it is rare to find a person who iscontent to live in complete isolation. Other key factors could be individualfreedom and a sense of purpose in life.
In conclusion, happiness is difficult to define because it is particular toeach individual, but I believe that our basic needs for shelter, food andcompany need to be fulfilled before we can experience it.",9
"The older generations tend to have very traditional ideas about howpeople should live, think and behave. However, some people believethat these ideas are not helpful in preparing younger generationsfor modern life.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this view?","It is true that many older people believe in traditional values that oftenseem incompatible with the needs of younger people. While I agree thatsome traditional ideas are outdated, I believe that others are still usefuland should not be forgotten.
On the one hand, many of the ideas that elderly people have about lifeare becoming less relevant for younger people. In the past, for example,people were advised to learn a profession and find a secure job for life,but today's workers expect much more variety and diversity from theircareers. At the same time, the 'rules' around relationships are beingeroded as young adults make their own choices about who and when tomarry. But perhaps the greatest disparity between the generations canbe seen in their attitudes towards gender roles. The traditional roles ofmen and women, as breadwinners and housewives, are no longeraccepted as necessary or appropriate by most younger people.
On the other hand, some traditional views and values are certainlyapplicable to the modern world. For example, older generations attachgreat importance to working hard, doing one's best, and taking pride inone's work, and these behaviours can surely benefit young people asthey enter today's competitive job market. Other characteristics that areperhaps seen as traditional are politeness and good manners. In ourglobalised world, young adults can expect to come into contact withpeople from a huge variety of backgrounds, and it is more important thanever to treat others with respect. Finally, I believe that young peoplewould lead happier lives if they had a more 'old-fashioned' sense ofcommunity and neighbourliness.
In conclusion, although the views of older people may sometimes seemunhelpful in today's world, we should not dismiss all traditional ideas asirrelevant.",9
"Many people prefer to watch foreign films rather than locallyproduced films. Why could this be?
Should governments give more financial support to local filmindustries?","It is true that foreign films are more popular in many countries thandomestically produced films. There could be several reasons why this isthe case, and I believe that governments should promote local film-making by subsidising the industry.
There are various reasons why many people find foreign films moreenjoyable than the films produced in their own countries. Firstly, theestablished film industries in certain countries have huge budgets foraction, special effects and to shoot scenes in spectacular locations.
Hollywood blockbusters like 'Avatar' or the James Bond films areexamples of such productions, and their global appeal is undeniable.
Another reason why these big-budget films are so successful is that theyoften star the most famous actors and actresses, and they are made bythe most accomplished producers and directors. The poor quality, low-budget filmmaking in many countries suffers in comparison.
In my view, governments should support local film industries financially.
In every country, there may be talented amateur film-makers who justneed to be given the opportunity to prove themselves. To compete withbig-budget productions from overseas, these people need money to payfor film crews, actors and a host of other costs related to producing high-quality films. If governments did help with these costs, they would see anincrease in employment in the film industry, income from film sales, andperhaps even a rise in tourist numbers. New Zealand, for example, hasseen an increase in tourism related to the 'Lord of the Rings' films, whichwere partly funded by government subsidies.
In conclusion, I believe that increased financial support could help to raisethe quality of locally made films and allow them to compete with theforeign productions that currently dominate the market.",9
"Some people think that strict punishments for driving offences arethe key to reducing traffic accidents. Others, however, believe thatother measures would be more effective in improving road safety.
Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","People have differing views with regard to the question of how to makeour roads safer. In my view, both punishments and a range of othermeasures can be used together to promote better driving habits.
On the one hand, strict punishments can certainly help to encouragepeople to drive more safely. Penalties for dangerous drivers can act as adeterrent, meaning that people avoid repeating the same offence. Thereare various types of driving penalty, such as small fines, licencesuspension, driver awareness courses, and even prison sentences. Theaim of these punishments is to show dangerous drivers that their actionshave negative consequences. As a result, we would hope that driversbecome more disciplined and alert, and that they follow the rules morecarefully.
On the other hand, I believe that safe driving can be promoted in severaldifferent ways that do not punish drivers. Firstly, it is vitally important toeducate people properly before they start to drive, and this could be donein schools or even as part of an extended or more difficult driving test.
Secondly, more attention could be paid to safe road design. For example,signs can be used to warn people, speed bumps and road bends can beadded to calm traffic, and speed cameras can help to deter people fromdriving too quickly. Finally, governments or local councils could reduceroad accidents by investing in better public transport, which would meanthat fewer people would need to travel by car.
In conclusion, while punishments can help to prevent bad driving, Ibelieve that other road safety measures should also be introduced.",9
"These days more fathers stay at home and take care of their childrenwhile mothers go out to work. What could be the reasons for this?
Do you think it is a positive or a negative development?","househusband, while more women than ever are the breadwinners intheir families. There could be several reasons for this, and I consider it tobe a very positive trend.
In recent years, parents have had to adapt to various changes in oursocieties. Equal rights movements have made great progress, and it hasbecome normal for women to gain qualifications and pursue a career. Ithas also become socially acceptable for men to stay at home and lookafter their children. At the same time, the rising cost of living has meantthat both marriage partners usually need to work and save money beforestarting a family. Therefore, when couples have children, they maydecide who works and who stays at home depending on the personalpreference of each partner, or based on which partner earns the mostmoney.
In my view, the changes described above should be seen as progress.
We should be happy to live in a society in which men and women haveequal opportunities, and in which women are not put under pressure tosacrifice their careers. Equally, it seems only fair that men should be freeto leave their jobs in order to assume childcare responsibilities if this iswhat they wish to do. Couples should be left to make their own decisionsabout which parental role each partner takes, according to their particularcircumstances and needs.
In conclusion, the changing roles of men and women in the family are aresult of wider changes in society, and I believe that these developmentsare desirable.",9
"More and more people are migrating to cities in search of a betterlife, but city life can be extremely difficult. Explain some of thedifficulties of living in a city. How can governments make urban lifebetter for everyone?","Cities are often seen as places of opportunity, but there are also somemajor drawbacks of living in a large metropolis. In my opinion,governments could do much more to improve city life for the averageinhabitant.
The main problem for anyone who hopes to migrate to a large city is thatthe cost of living is likely to be much higher than it is in a small town orvillage. Inhabitants of cities have to pay higher prices for housing,transport, and even food. Another issue is that urban areas tend to sufferfrom social problems such as high crime and poverty rates in comparisonwith rural areas. Furthermore, the air quality in cities is often poor, due topollution from traffic, and the streets and public transport systems areusually overcrowded. As a result, city life can be unhealthy and stressful.
However, there are various steps that governments could take to tacklethese problems. Firstly, they could invest money in the building ofaffordable or social housing to reduce the cost of living. Secondly,politicians have the power to ban vehicles from city centres and promotethe use of cleaner public transport, which would help to reduce both airpollution and traffic congestion. In London, for example, the introductionof a congestion charge for drivers has helped to curb the traffic problem.
A third option would be to develop provincial towns and rural areas, bymoving industry and jobs to those regions, in order to reduce the pressureon major cities.
In conclusion, governments could certainly implement a range ofmeasures to enhance the quality of life for all city residents.",9
"In some countries, many more people are choosing to live alonenowadays than in the past. Do you think this is a positive or negativedevelopment?","In recent years it has become far more normal for people to live alone,particularly in large cities in the developed world. In my opinion, this trendcould have both positive and negative consequences in equal measure.
The rise in one-person households can be seen as positive for bothpersonal and broader economic reasons. On an individual level, peoplewho choose to live alone may become more independent and self-reliantthan those who live with family members. A young adult who lives alone,for example, will need to learn to cook, clean, pay bills and manage hisor her budget, all of which are valuable life skills; an increase in thenumber of such individuals can certainly be seen as a positivedevelopment. From an economic perspective, the trend towards livingalone will result in greater demand for housing. This is likely to benefit theconstruction industry, estate agents and a whole host of other companiesthat rely on homeowners to buy their products or services.
However, the personal and economic arguments given above can beconsidered from the opposite angle. Firstly, rather than the positivefeeling of increased independence, people who live alone mayexperience feelings of loneliness, isolation and worry. They miss out onthe emotional support and daily conversation that family or flatmates canprovide, and they must bear the weight of all household bills andresponsibilities; in this sense, perhaps the trend towards living alone is anegative one. Secondly, from the financial point of view, a rise in demandfor housing is likely to push up property prices and rents. While this maybenefit some businesses, the general population, including those wholive alone, will be faced with rising living costs.
In conclusion, the increase in one-person households will have bothbeneficial and detrimental effects on individuals and on the economy.",9
"Some people think that all university students should studywhatever they like. Others believe that they should only be allowedto study subjects that will be useful in the future, such as thoserelated to science and technology.
Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","People have different views about how much choice students shouldhave with regard to what they can study at university. While some arguethat it would be better for students to be forced into certain key subjectareas, I believe that everyone should be able to study the course of theirchoice.
There are various reasons why people believe that universities shouldonly offer subjects that will be useful in the future. They may assert thatuniversity courses like medicine, engineering and information technologyare more likely to be beneficial than certain art degrees. From a personalperspective, it can be argued that these courses provide more jobopportunities, career progression, better salaries, and therefore animproved quality of life for students who take them. On the societal level,by forcing people to choose particular university subjects, governmentscan ensure that any knowledge and skill gaps in the economy arecovered. Finally, a focus on technology in higher education could lead tonew inventions, economic growth, and greater future prosperity.
In spite of these arguments, I believe that university students should befree to choose their preferred areas of study. In my opinion, society willbenefit more if our students are passionate about what they are learning.
Besides, nobody can really predict which areas of knowledge will be mostuseful to society in the future, and it may be that employers begin to valuecreative thinking skills above practical or technical skills. If this were thecase, perhaps we would need more students of art, history andphilosophy than of science or technology.
In conclusion, although it might seem sensible for universities to focusonly on the most useful subjects, I personally prefer the current systemin which people have the right to study whatever they like.",9
"Some people who have been in prison become good citizens later,and it is often argued that these are the best people to talk toteenagers about the dangers of committing a crime.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is true that ex-prisoners can become normal, productive members ofsociety. I completely agree with the idea that allowing such people tospeak to teenagers about their experiences is the best way to discouragethem from breaking the law.
In my opinion, teenagers are more likely to accept advice from someonewho can speak from experience. Reformed offenders can tell youngpeople about how they became involved in crime, the dangers of acriminal lifestyle, and what life in prison is really like. They can also dispelany ideas that teenagers may have about criminals leading glamorouslives. While adolescents are often indifferent to the guidance given byolder people, I imagine that most of them would be extremely keen tohear the stories of an ex-offender. The vivid and perhaps shocking natureof these stories is likely to have a powerful impact.
The alternatives to using reformed criminals to educate teenagers aboutcrime would be much less effective. One option would be for policeofficers to visit schools and talk to young people. This could be useful interms of informing teens about what happens to lawbreakers when theyare caught, but young people are often reluctant to take advice fromfigures of authority. A second option would be for school teachers tospeak to their students about crime, but I doubt that students would seeteachers as credible sources of information about this topic. Finally,educational films might be informative, but there would be no opportunityfor young people to interact and ask questions.
In conclusion, I fully support the view that people who have turned theirlives around after serving a prison sentence could help to deter teenagersfrom committing crimes.",9
"In many countries, a small number of people earn extremely highsalaries. Some people believe that this is good for the country, butothers think that governments should not allow salaries above acertain level.
Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","People have different views about whether governments shouldintroduce a maximum wage. While in some ways it may seem reasonableto allow people to earn as much as companies are willing to pay, Ipersonally believe that employee remuneration should be capped at acertain level.
There are various reasons why it might be considered beneficial to allowpeople to be paid extremely high salaries. If companies offer excellentpay packages, they can attract the most talented people in their fields towork for them. For example, technology companies like Google are ableto employ the best programmers because of the huge sums that they arewilling to pay. Furthermore, these well-paid employees are likely to behighly motivated to work hard and therefore drive their businessessuccessfully. In theory, this should result in a thriving economy andincreased tax revenues, which means that paying high salaries benefitseveryone.
However, I agree with those who argue that there should be a maximumwage. By introducing a limit on earnings, the pay-gap between bossesand employees can be reduced. Currently, the difference betweennormal and top salaries is huge, and this can demotivate workers whofeel that the situation is unfair. With lower executive salaries, it mightbecome feasible to introduce higher minimum wages, and everybodywould be better off. One possible consequence of greater equality couldbe that poverty and crime rates fall because the general population willexperience an improved standard of living.
In conclusion, it seems to me that it would be better, on balance, forgovernments to set a limit on the wages of the highest earners in society.",9
"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, weneed to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree ordisagree?","Climate change represents a major threat to life on Earth, but somepeople argue that we need to accept it rather than try to stop it. Icompletely disagree with this opinion, because I believe that we still havetime to tackle this issue and reduce the human impact on the Earth'sclimate.
There are various measures that governments and individuals could taketo prevent, or at least mitigate, climate change. Governments couldintroduce laws to limit the carbon dioxide emissions that lead to globalwarming. They could impose 鈥済reen taxes鈥 on drivers, airline companiesand other polluters, and they could invest in renewable energy productionfrom solar, wind or water power. As individuals, we should also try to limitour contribution to climate change, by becoming more energy efficient,by flying less, and by using bicycles and public transport. Furthermore,the public can affect the actions of governments by voting for politicianswho propose to tackle climate change, rather than for those who wouldprefer to ignore it.
If instead of taking the above measures we simply try to live with climatechange, I believe that the consequences will be disastrous. To give justone example, I am not optimistic that we would be able to cope with evena small rise in sea levels. Millions of people would be displaced byflooding, particularly in countries that do not have the means to safeguardlow-lying areas. These people would lose their homes and their jobs, andthey would be forced to migrate to nearby cities or perhaps to othercountries. The potential for human suffering would be huge, and it is likelythat we would see outbreaks of disease and famine, as well as increasedhomelessness and poverty.
In conclusion, it is clear to me that we must address the problem ofclimate change, and I disagree with those who argue that we can findways to live with it.",9
"Many governments think that economic progress is their mostimportant goal. Some people, however, think that other types ofprogress are equally important for a country.
Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","People have different views about how governments should measuretheir countries' progress. While economic progress is of course essential,I agree with those who believe that other measures of progress are justas important.
There are three key reasons why economic growth is seen as afundamental goal for countries. Firstly, a healthy economy results in jobcreation, a high level of employment, and better salaries for all citizens.
Secondly, economic progress ensures that more money is available forgovernments to spend on infrastructure and public services. Forexample, a government with higher revenues can invest in the country'stransport network, its education system and its hospitals. Finally, a strongeconomy can help a country's standing on the global stage, in terms ofits political influence and trading power.
However, I would argue that various other forms of progress are just assignificant as the economic factors mentioned above. In particular, weshould consider the area of social justice, human rights, equality anddemocracy itself. For example, the treatment of minority groups is oftenseen as a reflection of the moral standards and level of development ofa society. Perhaps another key consideration when judging the progressof a modern country should be how well that country protects the naturalenvironment, and whether it is moving towards environmentalsustainability. Alternatively, the success of a nation could be measuredby looking at the health, well-being and happiness of its residents.
In conclusion, the economy is obviously a key marker of a country'ssuccess, but social, environmental and health criteria are equallysignificant.",9
"As well as making money, businesses also have socialresponsibilities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Businesses have always sought to make a profit, but it is becomingincreasingly common to hear people talk about the social obligations thatcompanies have. I completely agree with the idea that businesses shoulddo more for society than simply make money.
On the one hand, I accept that businesses must make money in order tosurvive in a competitive world. It seems logical that the priority of anycompany should be to cover its running costs, such as employees' wagesand payments for buildings and utilities. On top of these costs, companiesalso need to invest in improvements and innovations if they wish toremain successful. If a company is unable to pay its bills or meet thechanging needs of customers, any concerns about social responsibilitiesbecome irrelevant. In other words, a company can only make a positivecontribution to society if it is in good financial health.
On the other hand, companies should not be run with the sole aim ofmaximising profit; they have a wider role to play in society. One socialobligation that owners and managers have is to treat their employeeswell, rather than exploiting them. For example, they could pay a 鈥渓ivingwage鈥 to ensure that workers have a good quality of life. I also like theidea that businesses could use a proportion of their profits to support localcharities, environmental projects or education initiatives. Finally, insteadof trying to minimise their tax payments by using accounting loopholes, Ibelieve that company bosses should be happy to contribute to societythrough the tax system.
In conclusion, I believe that companies should place as much importanceon their social responsibilities as they do on their financial objectives.",9
Some universities now offer their courses on the Internet so thatpeople can study online. Is this a positive or negative development?,"It is true that online courses are becoming a common feature of universityeducation. Although there are some drawbacks of Internet-basedlearning, I would argue that there are far more benefits.
The main drawback of the trend towards online university courses is thatthere is less direct interaction. Students may not have the opportunity toengage face-to-face with their teachers, and will instead have to rely onwritten forms of communication. Similarly, students who study online donot come into direct contact with each other, and this could have anegative impact on peer support, discussion and exchange of ideas. Forexample, whereas students on traditional courses can attend seminarsand even discuss their subjects over coffee after lessons, online learnersare restricted to chatting through website forum areas. These learnersmay also lack the motivation and element of competition that face-to-facegroup work brings.
Despite the negatives mentioned above, I believe that online universitycourses are a positive development for various reasons. Firstly, theyallow learners to study in a flexible way, meaning that they can workwhenever and wherever is convenient, and they can cover the materialat their own pace. Secondly, the cost of a university education can begreatly reduced, while revenues for institutions may increase as morestudents can be taught. Finally, online learning offers open access toanybody who is willing to study, regardless of age, location, ability andbackground. For example, my uncle, who is 65 years old, has recentlyenrolled on an online MBA course in a different country, which wouldhave been impossible in the days before Internet-based education.
In conclusion, while I recognise the possible disadvantages of onlinelearning, I consider it to be a positive development overall.",9
It is inevitable that traditional cultures will be lost as technologydevelops. Technology and traditional cultures are incompatible. Towhat extent do you agree or disagree with this view?,"Some people believe that technological developments lead to the loss oftraditional cultures. I partly agree with this assertion; while it may be truein the case of some societies, others seem to be unaffected bytechnology and the modern world.
On the one hand, the advances in technology that have drivenindustrialisation in developed countries have certainly contributed to thedisappearance of traditional ways of life. For example, in pre-industrialBritain, generations of families grew up in the same small villagecommunities. These communities had a strong sense of identity, due totheir shared customs and beliefs. However, developments in transport,communications and manufacturing led to the dispersal of families andvillage communities as people moved to the cities in search of work.
Nowadays most British villages are inhabited by commuters, many ofwhom do not know their closest neighbours.
On the other hand, in some parts of the world traditional cultures stillthrive. There are tribes in the Amazon Rainforest, for example, that havebeen completely untouched by the technological developments of thedeveloped world. These tribal communities continue to hunt and gatherfood from the forest, and traditional skills are passed on to children byparents and elders. Other traditional cultures, such as farmingcommunities in parts of Africa, are embracing communicationstechnologies. Mobile phones give farmers access to information, fromweather predictions to market prices, which helps them to prosper andtherefore supports their culture.
In conclusion, many traditional ways of life have been lost as a result ofadvances in technology, but other traditional communities have survivedand even flourished.",9
"Most people have forgotten the meaning behind traditional orreligious festivals; during festival periods, people nowadays onlywant to enjoy themselves. To what extent do you agree or disagreewith this opinion?","Some people argue that we no longer remember the original meaning offestivals, and that most of us treat them as opportunities to have fun.
While I agree that enjoyment seems to be the priority during festivaltimes, I do not agree that people have forgotten what these festivalsmean.
On the one hand, religious and traditional festivals have certainly becometimes for celebration. In the UK, Christmas is a good example of a festivalperiod when people are most concerned with shopping, giving andreceiving presents, decorating their homes and enjoying traditional mealswith their families. Most people look forward to Christmas as a holidayperiod, rather than a time to practise religion. Similar behaviour can beseen during non-religious festivals, such as Bonfire Night. Peopleassociate this occasion with making fires, watching firework displays, andperhaps going to large events in local parks; in other words, enjoymentis people's primary goal.
However, I disagree with the idea that the underlying meaning of suchfestivals has been forgotten. In UK primary schools, children learn indetail about the religious reasons for celebrating Christmas, Easter anda variety of festivals in other religions. For example, in late December,children sing Christmas songs which have a religious content, and theymay even perform nativity plays telling the story of Jesus' birth. Familiesalso play a role in passing knowledge of religious festivals' deepersignificance on to the next generation. The same is true for festivals thathave a historical background, such as Bonfire Night or Halloween, in thesense that people generally learn the stories behind these occasions atan early age.
In conclusion, although people mainly want to enjoy themselves duringfestivals, I believe that they are still aware of the reasons for thesecelebrations.",9
Extreme sports such as sky diving and skiing are very dangerousand should be banned. To what extent do you agree or disagree withthis view?,"In recent years, extreme sports have become increasingly popular, andsome people argue that governments should prohibit them. I completelydisagree with the idea that these sports are too dangerous, and Itherefore believe that they should not be banned.
In my opinion, so-called extreme sports are not as dangerous as manypeople think. All sports involve some element of risk, and there shouldalways be clear regulations and safety procedures to reduce thepossibility of accidents. People who take part in extreme sports areusually required to undergo appropriate training so that the dangers areminimised. For example, anyone who wants to try skydiving will need tosign up for lessons with a registered club, and beginners are not allowedto dive solo; they must be accompanied by an experienced professional.
Finally, the protective equipment and technology used in sports frommotor racing to mountain climbing is constantly improving safety.
While I support regulations and safety measures, I believe that it wouldbe wrong, and almost impossible, to ban extreme sports. In the first place,we should all be free to decide how we spend our leisure time; as longas we understand the risks, I do not believe that politicians should stopus from enjoying ourselves. However, an even stronger argument againstsuch a ban would be the difficulty of enforcing it. Many of the most riskysports, like base jumping or big wave surfing, are practised far away fromthe reach of any authorities. I cannot imagine the police being called tostop people from parachuting off a mountain face or surfing on an isolatedbeach.",9
